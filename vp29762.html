				<td colspan="2" class="postbody">Este texto es de alex, de la RSD, el mismo que escribio el articulo sobre la formula de la atraccion, es muy bueno.
<br />

<br />
Get into state. Because getting into state is good. When you are in state, you aren’t not out of state. And while this doesn’t necessarily make you attractive to girls, it certainly doesn’t make you unattractive. But, that depends. 
<br />
Honestly, and if you ask my closest friends in the company, I’m not really motivated by girls. One time I drunk dialed a friend’s ex girlfriend and exposed her to some verbal obscenities. But, as I was always shining through, she must have been attracted to my nimbus. When I asked her what her address was she was shocked. She must have thought it was for outer game purposes. Nope. The corner vendor has ceased to serve alcohol. 
<br />
I wanted to visit her house for inner game purposes.
<br />
Point is, when I asked her what her address was she was shocked, paused for a moment considering the oral lashing I had given her, and asked “why do you want my address?!”
<br />
‘For invitational purposes.’
<br />
Obviously.
<br />
She then volunteers her address. You beauty.
<br />
But, in my quest to get more state, I got distracted by the hermit crabs in the water fountain and I forget all about the Santa Claus style drop in she was expecting. No presents for her. State reigned supreme in my priorities.
<br />
When I rubbed my eyes and figured out where I was the next day, I came to the conclusion that she was attracted to me because I was more inspired by getting some state then I was inspired to give her a statement of outer game. This lead to the extrapolated conclusion that I should do more things like that, but be mindful to capitalise on my outer game inspiring state and share the love.
<br />
Results have been positive and medicinally compromising since.
<br />
For you, the budding glory monger, you may actually have your priorities out of order. Do you go out to ‘sarge’ or do you go out to irritate the bouncers of the establishment?
<br />
I see a lot of guys who go out for reasons other than themselves. To put anyone or anything in front of your cause is to assume that you are lower value than them, and hence, be unattractive. No girl will tell you her address.
<br />
The club is my office. But, I have no boss, only the agent Smiths. I can’t drink because I am at ‘work,’ so I just get into state and then say ‘whoa’ a lot.
<br />

<br />
Technically, state is default, and is what happens when you perceive that nothing stands in your way. When there is nothing in your head to prevent it from coming to you, you are in state. You can’t force it, though. Like so many other things, if you let go, it will come straight to you. But, not like money in the casino, that’s an exception. 
<br />
More technically, self esteem based state is proportionate to your ability to influence others. If you subscribe to natural game, state comes from within. The more people you have to influence, the more you call upon your resources from within, and like a siphon it just begins to flow. Slow at first, but it can build momentum.
<br />
Technically, if you do something positive, dominant or simply take action, you will move more towards state then you were previously. You want your cognitive traffic to cause the people around you to do matrix style limbo to avoid falling under your spell. But, they are only human. Bring more state and they will succumb to your presence.
<br />
What are the well know state building techniques? If you’re a bit of a beginner and want to get a bit of a smile up in the club, try talking to a few sets, singing, shouting, high fiving, or clapping your hands. 
<br />
Try it now. Sing this song... and follow the lyrics. Clap your hands, stand up, bob your knees and give someone a high five. Sing loud, break the shackles. You don’t have bad intentions, why would you limit yourself?
<br />
OK.. hit the song and sample some beginner state. Remember, whatever you feel she feels.
<br />

<br />

<br />
We rocked this song in France while intermittently screaming the mispronounced name of the scandalous French President: “SAR-COW-ZEE, FUCK YEAH!”
<br />
But, that stuff is for the faint of heart. There is a whole new range of self entertainment, state inspiring, and sanity obliterating pastimes that will induce seizures of laughter. They follow the same principles of taking action, creativity and positive dominance, only amplified.
<br />
I warn you. Do these wrong and you will end up in jail, an altercation or maybe knighted. Use at your own risk. 
<br />
The ‘Lime in the eye’. 
<br />
One of the best in the business: juice for tough guys. Anecdotally, only Australians can handle lime to the eyeball.
<br />
The ‘corporate elbow’. 
<br />
Take your left hand and scratch the back of your head. In doing so, out stretch your left elbow outwards and to head level. Now you have a limbo stick for others in the club to negotiate. 
<br />
The ‘umbilical cord’. 
<br />
Join several bendy straws together by pinching one straw so it is smaller in diameter than the other straw and insert inside. It must be an air tight connection. Now, you can drink for free, ninja style.
<br />
The ‘I lost my contact lens’. 
<br />
When a hot girl or girls (known as a ‘mingerwarren’) waltz by wearing short skirts exclaim loudly “I lost my contact lens!” in a manner that will draw attention to yourself. Drop to your hands and knees and lower you head as low as possible to the ground. From this angle, you can pose an opinion opener to the girl such as “can I get a quick female opinion on something. [female interlude] Have you seen my contact lens. With your head on the ground and their short skirts it makes for good angle of conversation.
<br />

<br />
The ‘legless drunk’. 
<br />
If you can put a wobble on your bipedal progressions and roll your eyes into anti-co-ordinated magic eight balls, then you can pass as a convincing drunk. In this pseudo-condition, you can knock cock blocking chodes over, motor boat cleavage capture girls in your arms as you try to regain your balance. This one is fun.
<br />
The ‘oceans one’. 
<br />
Somewhere in the venue there will be a security door with a numeric code required for access. Keep an eye on it. Usually the code won’t be longer than five or six figures. Note it or film it with your camera, and BOOM you’re in the Bellagio vault. Go in, find a uniform, suit up, then tend the bar, yet prioritizing your companions. Use said companions to bring girls to the free drink and watch them paw at your neck line as you tell them of your whiles. 
<br />
And for mayhem purposes (prepare to be immediately ejected)...
<br />
The ‘Grand Prix Podium’. 
<br />
This is much like a wet t-shirt contest, but the contestants aren’t aware of their involvement. So it’s kinda like Halloween. Buy a sultry three count of Pabst Blue Ribbon or other such shittery in bottle form. Cover the top with your thumb. Start a ruckus as though there is a bit of a shoving fight in the vicinity. In the commotion violently shake the beer at waist level. And voila...we have Spring Break. This is both an effective means for state, opening the girl and extracting the girl as they will probably get booted from the bar when Agent Smiths come at you talking of sociological prophecies.
<br />
Don’t let these maneuvers limit you. There are many more, far more creative, far less professional means by which to get into state. It’s the thrill of going against the norm, the thrill of immediate venue-removal and heightened sense of self from the attention that you will draw that makes these things and others so good for amping the state and fun. Make you and your fun the first priority of your night.
<br />
More often than not, the girls will think of you as silly and immature. This is, of course, the goal. Blend-Tec their congruence tests and establish A = HV + E. You have fun – they have fun. Everybody wins.
<br />
State like this will have the girls circling you as if you had your period in shark infested waters.
<br />
