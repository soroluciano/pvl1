    Myths and Truths
<br />

<br />
    ——————————————————————————–
<br />

<br />
    Date: 2006-04-18, 11:09PM PDT
<br />

<br />
    Some rants and accumulated experience about women. Men in happy marriages or stable relationships don’t need to read this; neither do men who get laid every week (or even every month). The “truth” I’m putting out here is for all of those men who, like me, worship women and can’t figure out why they keep getting screwed over and dumped. The myths are things that I used to believe before I wised up.
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: Women want love and affection. Women want to be treated well. If you treat a woman well, she’ll treat you well.
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: Young women want whatever other young women want. They’re herd creatures. If you lavish a woman with love and affection she’ll think you’re doing it because nobody else wants you (which may be true) and she’ll dump you. In fact, if you do anything that betrays that you’re a loser that other women won’t touch, she’ll dump you. Why? Because she wants to impress her friends with what a great catch she’s made, and if she thinks that they wouldn’t want you, then she doesn’t want you either.
<br />

<br />
    There are only three exceptions to this rule. The first exception is psychos, otherwise known as “witches, bitches, and crazy ladies.” They’ll stay with you because nobody else wants them, or because you’re the only one who put up with their abuse. The second exception is women who like to “fix men up”: those women who like to take “broken” men and turn them into the man they want. These women are single because a mature man will recognize that these women don’t want him… they want to turn him into someone else. The third exception is that once in a long time you meet a woman who isn’t psycho, still wants to stay with you when she finds out that you’re not super stud, and doesn’t want to change you into someone else. This is the one you marry.
<br />

<br />
    BITTER MYTH: Women are out for money.
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: Women are out for status and fun or for security, depending upon their age. A few women are out for cold cash, but not too many. Status-seeking women aren’t ready to settle down. They just wanna have fun, and they want their girlfriends to know it. They’re looking for a guy they can dangle in front of their friends and say, “Look what I got!” You don’t have to have money to be that guy, you just have to come across as desirable. Of course if you have money you don’t need to do anything else, but having no money isn’t the end of the world. The women who are out for security have had their wild fling and want to settle down. They want a guy who can provide a stable base for the future (and that includes finances).
<br />

<br />
    All in all it’s sort of like what guys do (and women whine about endlessly): when you’re young you want some bright, bubbly thing with huge tits, a nice ass, and a trimmed bush who screams like a banshee in bed, although you’ll settle for much less; when you’re ready to get married you want a nice girl who isn’t going to break your balls. They’re usually different people unless you’re very, very lucky. Young women want bad boys who will show them a good time. When they’re ready to get married they want some guy who is going to be able to pay to keep them comfortable.
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: Women are out for looks.
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: See above. Women are out for looks, after a fashion. A guy in good physical shape who wears decent-looking clothes is attractive because he looks after himself and probably isn’t a wimp or a whiner. She can convince her friends that he’s a “catch.” A guy who looks and smells like a laundry bin, or who can’t climb a few flights of stairs without a rest had better have some spectacular attribute to show off to her friends (like being a genius) or he’s not worth her time. Any guy can compensate for lack of looks or lack of money with showmanship. He doesn’t have to be a catch, just seem like one. All he has to do is make her friends think, “Damn, I wish I were going out with him instead of the loser I’m with.”
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: I should find one woman I like who likes me, and stick with her through thick and thin.
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: This is the biggest mistake I ever made. I used to be loyal to whomever I was with, even when someone better came along. All that happened was that I missed out on some great opportunities while I hung on with losers that ended up dumping me anyway. Do this if the two of you are getting married; once you’ve tied the knot it’s a whole other can of worms. However, if you’re just dating, do exactly the opposite. In very subtle ways you have to let her know that although you like her, there are lots of other women out there and you still notice them. Glance at tits and legs. Smile at and chat with pretty ladies, even while she’s with you (you’re just being friendly, of course). This is the most important thing I’ve learned about dating in a decade. I even thought of dating WASP bitches again, so long as I could keep this in mind. Never, never let her know that she’s the only game in town. As soon as she believes that she’s your “everything,” she’ll start whining and bitching and making demands.
<br />

<br />
    Think of it like buying a car. If you let the salesman know that this is your dream car, that you’ve stayed awake nights thinking about buying exactly this car, do you think the price will go down? Of course not! He’ll jack the price up as high as he thinks he can go and still have you buy it. If you tell your girl that you’ve dreamed all of your life of going out with someone like her, do you think she’ll smile and kiss you and things will go on as before? Of course not! She’ll realize that you’ll put up with more of her bad habits, and that she can put up with fewer of yours, and the bitching will start. She’ll try to make the relationship as comfortable for her as possible and still keep it going. Remember the car salesman? Remember the attitude that “this is a nice car, but there are hundreds of other great ones, including that one across the street”, even as your heart is thumping and you’re practically drooling? If you’re just dating, this is the attitude to take.
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: Having a girlfriend / fiancée / wife means being able to tell someone my problems.
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: Nobody gives a shit about your problems. Nobody ever will. I know that sounds harsh, but it’s the reality of being a man. Want to tell people about your problems? Get a sex change. Or join a men’s group; the flip side is that you have to listen to their problems, but it helps. I know of only two kinds of women who want to hear about your problems: ones with far more problems than you have, and ones who fancy themselves amateur psychiatrists and like “fixing” men. Neither is good company. Let’s face it: many women spend all day whining to their friends about how awful their lives are and listening to their neurotic friends responding in kind. The last thing they want to do is go out with you and hear more of the same.
<br />

<br />
    To make matters worse, women simply don’t “get” many of men’s problems. Women have problems with things that don’t even bother us, but they expect us to be understanding or at least tolerant; we have problems with things that don’t even bother them, and no amount of explaining will cause the light to go on or elicit any sympathy.
<br />

<br />
    So why not just commit hara-kiri now? Because it’s not that bad. You get over it. In particular, once you figure out how to handle women a lot of your problems seem smaller and more manageable.
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: Having a girlfriend / fiancée / wife means someone will finally understand me.
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: Understanding—true understanding—takes decades. If you spend most of your time with the love of your life trying to explain yourself, she will have nothing but contempt for you, for two reasons. First, because she doesn’t want to hear your whining (see above). Second, and more important, women want to maintain the self-delusion that they already understand men. Women everywhere claim that they understand men and that “men are simple creatures.” The truth is that women haven’t a clue where most men are coming from and furthermore they care only insofar as they want to control us. Nonetheless, they want to maintain the fiction that they have us figured out.
<br />

<br />
    It’s a pride and status thing. A woman who doesn’t “understand” her man can’t control him, and a woman who can’t control her man is a loser. The more you try to explain yourself, the more complex and multi-dimensional you become (a.k.a. “difficult”), and the less she can claim to understand you.
<br />

<br />
    Besides, most of the time you’re explaining yourself to her you’re really trying to figure yourself out. Go do it in a corner, hire a professional listener, or join a men’s group. She doesn’t want to hear it. If you master the art of keeping your problems to yourself she will complain bitterly about this. She will bitch and whine that you’re not open enough and that she has to drag things out of you. She will also secretly love this. It gives her one more thing to complain about to her friends.
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: If only I could meet the right woman, my life would have meaning.
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: If your life doesn’t have meaning right now, when you’re single, then a relationship isn’t going to help. You’ll pile too much baggage on top of the delicate emotional bonds too early, and the whole thing will collapse like a house of cards. Want to see this in action? Watch women: they do this all the time. In particular, women who whine about men who can’t make a commitment are probably doing exactly this: looking to a man to make their life mean something. It doesn’t work.
<br />

<br />
    The only way to have a happy life is to develop one for yourself, then leave an opening for someone else to come and share it with you. Neither of these two things is easy. In particular, it’s too easy once you’ve developed a life for yourself to end up with someone who was doing exactly what you were doing before—waiting for Prince Charming (or in your case Lady Love)—to come and rescue her life. People like this end up draining away all of that energy you’ve worked so hard to build up, leaving you exhausted and frustrated.
<br />

<br />
    Take it from me: I waited for Lady Love for decades. Finally I gave up, got angry, got off my ass and tried to make a life for myself, and suddenly I was surrounded by women who wanted to date me. After a while I met someone who was very special to me and I married her. Now my life is about the same as before, but I have someone with whom to share it. As much as I prefer being with someone, I must tell you that having her with me doesn’t make my life any more or less meaningful. I’m pretty much where I was before, only now I have company, which is nice.
<br />

<br />
    [P.S.: After two years she turned into one of those people who was waiting for her life to mean something, and she drained away all of my good energy. Oh well. Some things just don't turn out as planned, no matter how hard you try. Rats.]
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: If I treat a woman well and listen to what she says, she’ll stop complaining
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: Women never stop complaining. For them, it’s a sport. Some complain more than others, but none of them will ever stop, any more than one day men will stop discussing football. Men have built civilizations, created law, invented husbandry (that’s keeping domestic animals by the way, not marriage; women invented marriage), built skyscrapers, invented cars, washing machines, antibiotics, toilets, computers, and microwave ovens, and generally dragged us out of caves and into condos. Don’t kid yourself: men did it all. If it were up to women we’d still be living in caves and dying at 20. I know that men did it all because I know why they did it: they hoped that it would stop women complaining. It didn’t.
<br />

<br />
    If you listen to your girlfriend’s bitching and try to make everything better, you’ll suffer the same fate as all the men who came before: you’ll run yourself ragged, and at the end of it all she’ll still be bitching. If you ignore all but the most important complaints, she’ll bitch about that, too, but you’ll feel far better about your life.
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: Men don’t listen to women because men don’t care about women.
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: Men ignore women because women normally have nothing worthwhile to say. This is not a condemnation of women, but rather a difference in what talking is for. This is one of the few areas where John Gray has something useful to say. Men mull things over, organize things in their heads, then speak. Men have to do this because they have to get things done, and if they blabbered all day long about nothing in particular then eventually other men would pay them no attention. Men talk to communicate ideas, negotiate compromises, and secure cooperation. Life and experience has taught men to be brief and pithy.
<br />

<br />
    Women talk to organize their thoughts. It’s the difference between doing the math problem in your head and writing the answer at the top of the page, and scribbling all over the page in order to arrive at the answer in the bottom corner. Women want men to listen to them. Women want men to follow along as they scribble all over the page, not just wait for the answer. Quite frankly, who cares? As I mentioned above, there are lots of things that women don’t want to hear from men. If you want to talk about these things, you’ll have to find some other men who want to listen, because she sure as hell won’t. If she wants to attach her mouth to her brain and vocalize all of her mental processes then she should find someone who cares to listen, in other words another woman.
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: She said she loves me. She must think I’m really special.
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: When women say, “I love you” it can mean almost anything. “I want to spend the rest of my life with you,” “I’m desperate to get married and have babies and you’re the best thing I’ve come across so far,” “You’re better than the last jerk I went out with,” “You’re the best guy I’ve come across this week,” “All my girlfriends are in love and I want to be too,” “I have a million problems and I want you to feel obliged to listen to them,” “I want another date and I want you to feel like you have to ask me out again,” “It’s time I put my foot down and started controlling you,” and any number of other things. OK, most women think they mean it when they say, “I love you.” However, remember the old saying, “It’s a woman’s prerogative to change her mind”? She loves you this minute. Maybe today. Maybe this week. Maybe even this month. However, this says nothing about how she will feel next month, next week, or tomorrow.
<br />

<br />
    One of the biggest problems men like me have is that when we say, “I love you” to a woman we want to really mean it. Like “I love you forever.” Men don’t understand that a woman can say, “I love you forever” and change her mind next week. All she does is convinces herself that in hindsight, and despite everything you’ve ever said or done, you never really loved her, so all the times she said, “I love you” didn’t really count. You have to learn to use the same language. Go ahead and say, “I love you,” but inside your head say, “I love you right now. Tomorrow may be a different story.” When you break up and she screams that you said you loved her, tell her that you did, but she did this and that and now you don’t love her any more. When women say, “I love you” they aren’t promising eternal devotion, so why should you be? One day you’ll meet a woman who says, “I love you” and it’ll really hit home. You’ll test her love a bit and it will hold up. That’s the one you marry.
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: Women understand relationships; men don’t.
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: This myth is perpetuated by women, pussy-whipped men, and psychiatrists. If women truly understood relationships… that is, if they understood relationships with men… then we wouldn’t have a 45% divorce rate. Maybe back in the pioneer days women understood relationships. These days, they have coffee with their girlfriends, talk about “men”, examine and dissect relationships, study interpersonal dynamics, talk, talk, talk about what works and what doesn’t, then go out and perfectly screw up their next relationship. I know. I’ve watched it happen from the sidelines.
<br />

<br />
    Women spend more time analyzing relationships; they talk about them incessantly, and in doing so discover more truths than men know. However, all of this talk in a vacuum also means that their heads are filled with more bullshit and myth than are men’s. The combination of superior insight and copious nonsense puts them right back where we are. Men tend to see what’s going on in a relationship more clearly, but have no idea how to express what they see or what to do about it. Women would probably know what to do about it if they could only see it as it truly is, instead of through a fog of preconception.
<br />

<br />
    The other big difference between the sexes is that women are absolutely certain that they know what is going on, whereas men make no such claim. The last man who claimed to have his own radical theories about relationships was Freud, and nobody pays any attention to him any more. It is women’s ideas about relationships and why they do or don’t work that have been imported lock, stock, and barrel into the field of psychiatry. Most male therapists you’ll meet are basically honorary women with university degrees, and as such they don’t really understand relationships either.
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: Women are fairer and more even-handed than men
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: Nothing could be further from the truth. Traditionally men have favoured the same rules for everyone: “He who lives by the sword dies by the sword.” Women on the other hand make up the rules as they go along. Although women’s approach is patently unfair, it was valuable when they had to be the ones to point out that the rules needed to be changed, or that the rules should be bent in some cases. Back then they did this for the good of everyone. These days men still feel bound by rules, but women are in a conflict of interest. They still keep watch over the rules and break them as they always have, but now they modify and break the rules in their own favour.
<br />

<br />
    Men’s justice is often harsh, but it’s fair. Women’s justice is arbitrary and these days often self-serving. (Liberal “situational ethics” are essentially the same as women’s ethics.) You’ll find this out quickly in a relationship. The joke going around about “The Rules” and how women change them all the time isn’t such a joke. It’s a documentary. If you doubt this, think of it this way. A man caught breaking or bending the rules of good behaviour will become either defensive or repentant; his wife will beat him over the head with his transgression for months, if not years. A woman caught modifying the rules of good behaviour to suit herself will giggle and freely admit it. She thinks it’s a game.
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: Women do a lot for the relationship; men do a lot for themselves
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: My ex-girlfriend invented a little ditty that made her puff up with smug, self-satisfied pride. It went like this, “Women think of ‘we’; men think of ‘me’.” OK, so e.e. cummings she wasn’t. The point is that she actually believed this, and a lot of other women do, too. She thought that she was living and breathing our “relationship,” while I was just kind of hanging around and taking up space. Meanwhile, I drove her everywhere (she couldn’t drive), I spent hours making her gifts and writing her notes, and I spent hours thinking about what was going on with us and where we were going.
<br />

<br />
    The truth of the matter is that women don’t think of ‘we’ any more or less often than men do. Women think of their own needs most of the time, too. The difference is that women redefine their own needs as being those of “the relationship”. For example, when a man needs to talk to his belle about something, he says, “I need to talk to you.” When a woman needs to talk to her beau about something, she says, “We need to talk.” Notice the difference? Suddenly what she needs becomes what we need. Women do this all the time, and then pout and whine that they work so hard at the relationship and you don’t. In fact they’re just playing with words.
<br />

<br />
    The other truth is that there are two relationships: the one you’re really in—the one that exists between you and her—and the one in her head. Remember how women are always talking and theorizing about “relationships”? Well, much of what she defines as “our relationship” is really just a collection of theories and prejudices from past conversations with her girlfriends, and has nothing to do with what’s going on between the two of you. In that sense, even if she is doing more for “the relationship,” it isn’t necessarily anything that concerns her real relationship with you.
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: Women are more involved in the relationship; men are more aloof.
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: Finally one that’s true. The false part is the assumption that being deeply involved in the relationship is always a good thing, and that aloofness is fatal to relationships. If you doubt this, look around you and find a couple in which both people do little else but sit around with each other and talk, and watch how fast the relationship blows itself apart. Every relationship has to have a balance between looking inward and looking outward. Most women who complain that their men don’t pay enough attention to “the relationship” aren’t seeing the relationship clearly and/or are buried in “the relationship” up to their necks and so are creating more problems than they solve. Recently I was skimming a book by Dr. Laura and saw a chapter that gets this one right. Where is it written that when a man wants to go back to college and a woman wants to get married, and she gets angry that he’s “not thinking of the relationship” that she’s automatically right? Maybe the right thing to do at that moment is for both of them to go back to college for a couple of years. Women confuse obsessing about “the relationship” with healthy involvement, particularly considering that half the time they’re seeing stuff that isn’t even there. Sometimes your relationship needs more attention than you’re giving it; other times she’s smothering it. The assumption that more involvement equals more love simply isn’t true.
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: When she says no, she means no (so why am I so confused)?
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: Nobody means no every time they say “no.” Think about it: do you? You’ve never said no when you were too shy to say yes? You’ve never said no because you were nervous, didn’t know what you were getting into, and didn’t really have time to think about your answer? You’ve never said no because you thought that was the right thing to do even though you really wanted to say yes? You’ve never said no and then changed your mind? You’ve never said no as a joke, just to get a rise out of someone, when you really meant yes?
<br />

<br />
    I’ve done all of these things at one time or another; most men I know have, and most women I know have as well. However, for men there’s a catch. If she’s prone to saying no when she really means yes, then you should dump her. Immediately. Especially if she’s told you in no uncertain terms “no” and then starts dropping huge hints that you’re supposed to ignore this and go for it anyway. Dump the bitch. This is just far too dangerous. If you doubt this, imagine sitting in court, accused of rape. “Did she tell you no, Mr. Smith?” “Yeah, but afterward she tried to rip my pants off, then stripped naked and sat on my face!” “But did she say no, Mr. Smith?” “Umm… yes she did.” “Case closed.”
<br />

<br />
    I once went out with a woman who told me, on our second date, that there was no way she would sleep with me, that her ex-boyfriend was coming to visit and that it would be “too complicated” if she were sleeping with me when he came to stay. On our third date she did everything to let me know that she wanted me, including lying on my bed, making comments about removing her clothes for a nude massage. Spooked, I drove her home, dropped her off, and never went out with her again. I consider it one of the smartest things I’ve done in my dating life. (Incidentally, apparently so does she. Every time I meet her she asks why I don’t call her any more.)
<br />

<br />
    MYTH: Women are social geniuses; all women get along well with each other, while men just fight
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: I lived in a mixed-sex dorm for two years in university where each floor was segregated by sex. It alternated: one floor men, one floor women, one floor men, etc. A few nearby residences were completely mixed. A couple of the men’s floors looked much the worse for wear at the end of the year. You know, men are so destructive. The women’s floors all looked perfect. All the girls were smiling and friendly. Talk to any of them, however, and they’d tell you that they hated living on an all-female floor, and every last damned one of them was moving to the mixed dorms the very next year, and not with each other. According to them, underneath the tidy rooms and smiles were claws and forked tongues. Every day was a quiet, mannerly, pitched social battle. The men, on the other hand, got along just fine with only a few exceptions. Most of us were quite happy where we were, the only complaint being that we didn’t see the ladies enough.
<br />

<br />
    One thing that is true along the lines of this myth is that any woman will defend another woman against a man, even a woman that she doesn’t know. Start bad-mouthing women, even a particular woman that isn’t known to “present company,” and you’ll find women defending her even though they have no idea what’s going on. If anyone—a woman or another man—verbally attacks a man, other men will not jump in and defend him. Why? Men assume that other men can look after themselves and, after all, they’re competition. Women assume that an attack on one woman is an attack on all women.
<br />

<br />
    BITTER MYTH: Women are all the same.
<br />

<br />
    TRUTH: Women are not all the same, and in particular women change with age. A woman who wouldn’t give you a second look at 15 may be asking you out at 35. In part this is the dreaded “biological clock” at work, but in part it’s also changing priorities. At 15 she wants to impress all of her friends with her “catch” and she is starting to learn to control men. She wants variety and excitement. At 25 she wants to have fun with no strings attached and wants to hone her controlling skills. She wants more stability but she doesn’t want Ward Cleaver or Bill Gates. At 35 she realizes that the fun days are over and it’s time to settle down and get serious.
<br />

<br />
    Boring, nerdy guys who were dog meat at 15 can be studs at 35. The guys grow up and mature, they learn to need women less, and they settle into a life of resigned solitude, which means that they cheer up because they’re no longer striving for something they can’t have. The field narrows, and there are fewer single guys with no divorce history. Finally, her priorities have changed. She’s no longer impressed by “bad boys” on motorcycles with a few convictions for petty crime. She knows that her friends aren’t impressed by flashy, fast-living rogues any longer, any more than they’re still impressed by fashions from Suzy Creamcheese. She’s more interested in building a nest than impressing her friends anyway (and she knows that building a nest is what will impress them). So, just because you can’t get anywhere now doesn’t mean that your whole life will be a write-off. Take a clue from me: I never had a single date in high school. I had one girlfriend for a year in University. Ten years later I was beating women off with a stick.<br /><br />_________________<br />the more you 'advance as a community PUA' the more mainstream you become... eventually you do exactly what you did as a total AFC but simply without the neediness, and voila... you get girls.<span class="gensmall"></span></td>

Mitos y verdades
<br />
——————————————————————————– 
<br />

<br />
Fecha: 2006-04-18, 11:09PM PDT 
<br />

<br />
Algunos putean y acumulan experiencias con las mujeres. Hombres en matrimonios felices o relaciones estables no necesitan leer esto, tampoco hombres que cojan todas las semanas (o todos los meses). La “verdad” que estoy mostrando es para todos aquellos que, como yo, trabajan a las minas y no pueden entender por que siguen siendo rebotados. Los mitos son ideas que solía creer antes de avivarme.
<br />

<br />
MITO: Las minas quieren amor y afectividad. Quieren ser tratadas bien. Si tratas a una mujer bien, ella hará lo mismo. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Las mujeres jóvenes quieren lo mismo que otro hombre querría. Son criaturas de manada. Si agasajas a una mujer con amor y afectividad, ella va a creer que lo haces por que nadie te da bola (lo que puede ser verdad) y te va a rebotar. De hecho, si haces cualquier cosa que de a entender que eres un perdedor y que otra mina no te tocaría, te va a rebotar. ¿Por que? Porque ella quiere impresionar a sus amigas con que se agarro uno bueno, y si ella cree que no le gustarías a sus amigas, entonces a ella tampoco. 
<br />

<br />
Hay solo 3 excepciones a esta regla. La primera es las sicópatas, también conocidas como “brujas, putas y locas”. Estarán contigo por que nadie más las quiere, o por que eres el único que les permite su abuso. La segunda excepción son las mujeres que les gusta “arreglar” a los hombres, esas minas que agarran un hombre “malo” y lo moldean como el hombre que a ellas les gusta. Esas minas están solteras ya que un hombre maduro reconocería que no lo quieren a él sino que quieren transformarlo en otra persona. La tercera excepción es que cuando conoces a alguien que no es psicópata, quiere estar con vos cuando se da cuenta que no eres un súper galán, y no te quiere transformar en otro. Esa es la mina con que te casas. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
MITO AMARGO: A las minas les gusta la plata.  
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Las minas buscan status y diversión, o seguridad dependiendo de su edad. Pocas mujeres buscan solo plata, pero no demasiadas. Las que buscan status no están preparadas para asentarse. Quieren pasarla bien, y que sus amigas lo sepan. Buscan un hombre que puedan lucir en frente de sus amigas y decir “Mira lo que conseguí”. No tienes que tener plata para ser ese, solo tienes que ser deseable para ella. Obviamente si tienes plata es mucho mas fácil, pero no tenerla no es el fin del mundo. Las minas que quieren seguridad ya tuvieron su periodo de joda y buscan instalarse. Quieren un hombre que les provea una base estable para el futuro (finanzas incluidas). 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
En el fondo es parecido a lo que los hombres hacen (y que las minas se quejan siempre): cuando eres joven, quieres una mina bonita, con buenas tetas, buen culo y depilada que grite como condenada en la cama, aunque al final te conformes con otra cosa; cuando estas listo para casarte quieres una buena mina que no te va a romper las pelotas. Por lo general no son las mismas minas, al menos que tengas mucha, mucha suerte. Las minas jóvenes quieren hombres malos que las diviertan. Cuando estén listas para casarse quieren un hombre que este dispuesto a pagar para mantenerlas cómodas. 
<br />

<br />
MITO: A las minas les gustan los facheros. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Date cuenta. Un flaco en buena forma física y que usa ropa piola es atractivo por que probablemente le demuestra que no es un quejón o un debilucho. Ella puede convencer a sus amigas de que esta bueno. Un flaco que huele a canasto del lavado, o que no puede subir una escalera completa sin descansar tiene que tener atributos espectaculares para que ella muestre a sus amigas (como ser un genio) o no valdría la pena. Cualquier hombre puede compensar la falta de facha o plata siendo showman. No tiene que ser un galán, solo aparentarlo. Todo lo que tiene que hacer es que sus amigas piensen “Me gustaría salir con ese flaco en vez del perdedor con el que estoy”. 
<br />

<br />
MITO: Tengo que encontrar una mina que me guste y quedarme con ella a pesar de todo. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Este es el peor error que hice. Solía ser leal con quien quiera que estuviera, incluso cuando algo mejor podría venir. Todo lo que sucedió fue que me perdí muchas buenas oportunidades mientras salía con perdedoras que me terminaban pateando igualmente. Compórtate así si es que estas casado, una vez ahí es otra cosa. Pero si estas recién saliendo con una mina, haz justo lo contrario. De manera sutil, debes hacerle saber que a pesar de que te gusta, hay muchas otras mujeres por ahí y tú te das cuenta. Mira piernas y tetas. Sonríe y habla con minas lindas, incluso cuando ella este contigo (solo estas siendo amistoso, obvio). Esta es la cosa más importante que aprendí en más de una década saliendo con minas. Nunca, nunca le hagas saber que es el único juego que tienes disponible. Tan pronto ella crea que eres su “todo” va a empezar a quejarse, histeriquear y pedirte cosas. 
<br />

<br />
Piensa en cuando compras un auto. Si le dices al vendedor que es el auto de tus sueños, que te quedaste despierto noches pensando en el momento de comprar ese auto, crees que te va a hacer una rebaja? Obvio que no!, te va a subir el precio lo mas alto que el crea como para quitarte toda la plata que estas dispuesto a pagar. Si le dices a tu mina que soñaste toda tu vida con salir con alguien como ella, crees que las cosas van a seguir como antes? Obvio que no! Se dará cuenta que le vas a empezar a aguantar sus malos hábitos y que ella no tendrá que hacerlo con los tuyos. El puterío va a empezar, tratará de hacer la relación cómoda para ella y de seguir contigo. Recuerda la actitud de “ este es un buen auto, pero hay cientos de otros parecidos, incluido ese que esta al frente” a pesar de que el corazón se te salga y estés babeando, esa es la actitud si es que recién estas saliendo. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
MITO: Tener novia / prometida / esposa implica tener a alguien a quien contarle mis problemas. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: A nadie le importa un carajo tus problemas. A nadie. Se que suena un poco duro, pero es la realidad de ser un hombre. Quieres contarle a la gente tus problemas? Cambiate de sexo. O unite a un grupo de hombres, la lata va a ser que tendrás que escuchar sus problemas, pero ayuda. Solo conozco dos clases de mujeres que escucharían tus problemas: las que tienen mas problemas que tu y a las que les gusta la onda siquiátrica y les gusta arreglar a los hombres. Ninguna es buena compañía. Seamos honestos: muchas minas pasan todo el día quejándose con sus amigas lo horrible que es su vida y escuchando a sus amigas neuróticas responderle lo mismo. Lo último que quieren es salir contigo y escuchar algo parecido. 
<br />

<br />
Para hacer las cosas peores, las minas no elijen hombres con muchos problemas. Las mujeres tienen problemas con cosas que a nosotros no nos importan, pero esperan que seamos comprensivos o al menos tolerantes, nosotros tenemos problemas con cosas que a ellas no les importa y ninguna explicación va a hacer que ellas entiendan. 
<br />

<br />
Entonces por que no pegarte un tiro ahora? Por que no es tan malo. Lo aprendes a llevar. En particular, una vez que te diste cuenta como manejar a las mujeres muchos de tus problemas van a parecer más chicos y más manejables. 
<br />

<br />
MITO: Tener novia / prometida / esposa implica que alguien finalmente me va a entender. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: El entendimiento, verdadero, toma décadas. Si gastas la mayor parte de tu tiempo con el amor de tu vida tratando de explicarte a ti mismo, ella no tendrá nada mas que hacer que asentir, por dos razones. Primero, porque no quiere oírte quejar. Segundo, y mas importante, por que a las mujeres les gusta creer que ya conocen a los hombres. Las mujeres de todas partes dicen que entienden a los hombres y que son “criaturas simples”. La verdad es que las minas no tienen idea de donde vienen los hombres y se preocupan solo con afanes de controlarnos. Igualmente, les gusta creer la ficción de que nos conocen bien. 
<br />

<br />
Es una cosa de orgullo y estatus. Una mujer que no “entiende” su hombre, no lo puede controlar y por ende es una perdedora. Mientras más trates de explicarte a ti mismo, mas complejo y multidimensional te vuelves y de esta forma ella no puede decir que te conoce. 
<br />

<br />
Además, la mayor parte del tiempo te estas dando a conocer a ella, realmente quieres mostrarte como eres. Hazlo en una esquina, contrata un escuchador profesional o únete a un grupo de hombres. Ella no quiere escucharlo. Si dominas el arte de mantener tus problemas para ti mismo ella se va a quejar amargamente con respecto a eso. Te va a putear e histeriquear que no eres abierto y que tiene que sacarte las palabras. Secretamente ella ama eso. Le da una cosa mas de que quejarse con sus amigas. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
MITO: Si tan solo pudiera conocer la mujer correcta, mi vida tendría sentido. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Si tu vida no tiene sentido en este minuto, cuando estas soltero, entonces una relación no te va a ayudar. Apilaras mucho peso encima de los delicados vínculos emocionales muy temprano y toda la estructura colapsará como una torre de cartas. Quieres ver esto en acción? Mira a las mujeres, lo hacen todo el tiempo. En particular, las mujeres que se quejan de los hombres que no quieren compromiso están probablemente haciendo exactamente esto: buscando un hombre para que su vida tenga sentido. No funciona. 
<br />

<br />
La única forma de tener una vida feliz es desarrollarse uno mismo, personalmente, y luego dejar la opción de que alguien venga y lo comparta contigo. Ninguna de esas dos cosas es simple. En particular, es demasiado fácil una vez que desarrollaste tu vida, terminar con alguien que estaba haciendo exactamente lo que tu hacías antes (esperar por el príncipe encantado), que venga y quiera que rescates su vida. Esta gente termina quitándote toda la energía que construiste con mucho esfuerzo, dejándote exhausto y frustrado.  
<br />

<br />
Tómalo de mi parte: Esperé por la mina correcta décadas. Al final me rendí, me enoje, y trate de hacer mi vida yo mismo. De repente estaba rodeado de mujeres que querían salir conmigo. De ahí conocí alguien muy especial y me casé. Ahora mi vida es muy parecida a antes, pero tengo alguien para compartirla. A pesar de que prefiera estar con alguien, debo decirte que tenerla a mi lado no implica que tenga mayor o menor sentido mi vida. Estoy seguro de lo que era antes, ahora solo tengo compañía, lo que esta bueno. 
<br />

<br />
PD: Después de dos años, ella se transformo en una de esas personas que esperaba que su vida tomara sentido conmigo, y me quito toda mi buena energía. Algunas cosas no funcionan como planeado, no importa cuanto trates. Maldición. 
<br />

<br />
MITO: Si trato a una mujer bien, y escucho lo que me dice, parará de quejarse. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Las minas nunca paran de quejarse. Para ellas es un deporte. Algunas se quejan mas que otras, pero ninguna de ellas parará jamás, como nunca pararan los hombres de discutir sobre fútbol. Los hombres crearon civilizaciones, las leyes, mantener mascotas (el matrimonio lo inventaron las mujeres), construyeron rascacielos, inventaron los autos, las maquinas de lavar, antibióticos, baños, computadores y hornos microondas, nos arrastraron de las cavernas a los condominios. No te engañes, los hombres hicieron todo. Si fuera por las minas estaríamos todavía viviendo en las cavernas y muriendo a los 20. Se que los hombres hicieron todo eso por que se la razón por la cual lo hicieron: esperaban que eso podría hacer que las minas terminaran de quejarse. No fue así. 
<br />

<br />
Si escuchas a tu mina quejarse y tratar de hacer todo mejor, vas a sufrir el mismo destino que todos los hombres que vinieron antes: vas a terminar hecho mierda y al final ella igual va a seguir quejándose. Si ignoras todo menos las quejas más importantes, igualmente se va a quejar, pero al menos te vas a sentir mejor con respecto a tu vida. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
MITO: Los hombres no escuchan a las minas por que no se interesan por ellas. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Los hombres ignoran a las mujeres por que estas normalmente no tienen nada importante que decir. No es una crítica a la mujer, sino que una diferencia en el enfoque del sentido de hablar. Esta es una de las pocas áreas donde John Gray tiene algo útil que decir. Los hombres piensan, organizan las ideas en su cabeza y luego hablan. Lo hacen así debido a que tienen que hacer cosas y si hablaran tonteras todo el día otros hombres no le darían bola. Los hombres hablan para comunicar ideas, negociar compromisos y asegurar cooperación. La vida y la experiencia le ha enseñado a los hombres a ser breves y concisos. 
<br />
 
<br />
Las mujeres hablan para organizar sus pensamientos. Es la diferencia entre resolver el problema de matemática en tu cabeza y escribir la respuesta al inicio de la hoja, y escribir todo el desarrollo para llegar a la respuesta al final de ésta. Las mujeres quieren que los hombres las escuchen, quieren que las sigan mientras desarrollan el problema de matemática, no solo esperar la respuesta. Francamente, a quien le importa? Como mencione antes hay muchas cosas que las mujeres no quieren oír de los hombres. Si quieres hablar de esas cosas, tendrás que encontrar otros hombres que quieran escuchar ya que ella seguramente no querrá.
<br />

<br />
MITO: Ella dice que me ama. Debe pensar que soy realmente especial. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Cuando las minas dicen “te amo” puede significar casi cualquier cosa. “Quiero pasar el resto de mi vida contigo”, “Estoy desesperada por casarme y tener hijos, y eres lo mejor con lo que me cruce hasta el momento”, “Eres mejor que el ultimo pelotudo con que salí”, “Eres el mejor flaco con el que me tope esta semana”, “Todas mis amigas tienen novio, y yo quiero uno también”, “Tengo millones de problemas y quiero que te sientas obligado a oírme”, “Es tiempo de que te ponga el pie encima y empiece a controlarte” y otro numero de cosas. OK, muchas mujeres creen realmente que sienten de adentro cuando dicen “Te Amo”, pero recuerda el viejo dicho “Es prerrogativa de las mujeres cambiar de idea”. Ella te ama en ese minuto, a lo mejor hoy, tal vez esta semana, este mes. Pero esto no implica como va a sentirse el próximo mes, semana o mañana incluso. 
<br />

<br />
Uno de los grandes problemas que tenemos los hombres como yo es que cuando le decimos “te amo” a una mujer, realmente lo sentimos. Como “te amo para siempre”. Los hombres no entienden que una mujer puede decir “te amo para siempre” y pensar diferente la próxima semana. Todo lo que hace es convencerse ella misma de que a pesar de todo lo que dijiste e hiciste, nunca la amaste realmente, por lo tanto todas las  veces que ella dijo “te amo” nunca valieron. Debes aprender a usar el mismo lenguaje. Anda y dile “te amo”, pero por dentro piensa “te amo en este momento, mañana puede ser otra historia”. 
<br />

<br />
Cuando terminas y ella grita que tú dijiste que la amabas, dile que lo hiciste, pero ella hizo esto y aquello y ahora ya no la amas más. Cuando las minas dicen “te amo” no están prometiendo devoción eterna, entonces por que tu si debieras? Un día conocerás a una mujer que te diga “te amo” y realmente te va a llegar. Vas a probar su amor un poco y se mantendrá. Esa es con la que te casas. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
MITO: Las mujeres entienden las relaciones, los hombres no. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Este mito es perpetuado por mujeres, pollerudos y siquiatras. Si las minas realmente entendieran las relaciones con los hombres, no tendríamos una tasa de divorcio del 45%. Por ahí antes en el tiempo las mujeres entendían las relaciones. Por estos días ellas toman café con sus amigas, hablan mucho de hombres, examinan las relaciones, estudian dinámicas interpersonales, hablan, hablan, hablan de trabajo y luego van y arruinan su próxima relación. Lo se, lo he visto ocurrir desde afuera.  
<br />

<br />
Ellas pasan más tiempo analizando las relaciones, hablan de ellas incesantemente y de esta manera descubren más verdades de las que el hombre conoce. Pero esto solo llena sus cabezas de mierda y mitos de cómo son los hombres. La combinación de un sentimiento superior y mucho sinsentido las pone en el lugar que está. Los hombres ven lo que pasa en una relación mas claramente, pero no tienen idea de cómo expresar lo que ven o que hacer al respecto. Las mujeres probablemente sabrían que hacer si pudieran ver la verdad claramente y no una nube de humo llena de preconceptos. 
<br />

<br />
La otra gran diferencia entre los sexos es que las mujeres tienen absoluta certeza de que ellas saben que esta pasando, cuando los hombres no hacen tal declaración. El ultimo hombre que dijo tener sus propias radicales teorías fue Freíd y nadie le da bola actualmente. Son las ideas de las minas con respecto a las relaciones las que son aceptadas ciegamente en el campo de la psiquiatría. Muchos terapistas hombres que existen son básicamente mujeres honorarias con grado universitario y por esto tampoco son capaces de entender las relaciones.  
<br />

<br />
MITO: Las mujeres son más justas e igualitarias que los hombres.  
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Nada puede estar más alejado de la realidad. Tradicionalmente los hombres han utilizado las mismas reglas para todos: “El que vive por la espada, muere por la espada”. Las mujeres por otro lado manipulan las reglas a su medida. A pesar de que su forma de ser puede parecer injusta, gracias a ellas las reglas a veces son cambiadas o modificadas. Actualmente los hombres siguen apegados a las reglas, pero las mujeres tienen un conflicto de intereses. Siguen vigilando las reglas y rompiéndolas como siempre, pero ahora las modifican para su propio beneficio. 
<br />

<br />
La justicia de los hombres es a menudo ruda, pero justa. La justicia de las mujeres es arbitraria y actualmente hecha para ellas. Te darás cuenta rápidamente de esto en una relación. La broma acerca de “las reglas” y como las minas las cambian todo el tiempo no es una broma, es un documental. Si dudas de esto, piensa de esta manera. Un hombre pillado rompiendo las reglas de buen comportamiento se volverá defensivo o se reprimirá, su mujer lo jodera al respecto por meses sino años. Una mujer pillada modificando las reglas de buen comportamiento se reirá y lo admitirá libremente. Piensa que es un juego. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
MITO: Las mujeres hacen mucho por la relación, los hombres hacen mucho por ellos mismos. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Mi ex invento un dicho que la hacia sentir orgullosa. “Las mujeres piensan en “nosotros” (we), los hombres piensan en “yo” (me)”. Ella realmente creía que esto era verdad y otras mujeres también. Ella creía que estaba viviendo y respirando “nuestra” relación, mientras yo estaba al pedo y malgastando aire. Pero era yo el que la llevaba a todos lados (no sabia manejar), era yo el que me pasaba horas haciéndole regalos y escribiéndole cartas, y me gastaba horas pensando que pasaba entre nosotros y hacia donde íbamos. 
<br />

<br />
La verdad del asunto es que las mujeres no piensan en “nosotros” en menor o mayor cantidad que los hombres. Las minas piensan en sus propias necesidades la mayor parte del tiempo, al igual que nosotros. La diferencia es que las mujeres redefinen sus necesidades como las de “la relación”. Por ejemplo cuando un hombre necesita hablarle a su mina de algo le dice “necesito hablarte”. Cuando la mina quiere hablarle a su novio de algo ella dice “necesitamos hablar”. Te das cuenta de la diferencia? De repente lo que ella necesita se transforma en algo que los dos necesitamos. Las mujeres hacen esto todo el tiempo, y luego se quejan de que trabajan mucho por la relación y que nosotros no. De hecho, solo están jugando con las palabras. 
<br />

<br />
La otra verdad es que existen dos relaciones para ellas: la cual en la que estas (la que existe entre tu y ella) y la que tiene ella en su cabeza. Recuerdas como las mujeres hablan y teorizan acerca de las “relaciones”? Bueno mucho de lo que define “nuestra” relación es realmente una colección de teorías y prejuicios de conversaciones pasadas con sus amigas y no tiene nada que ver con lo que realmente pasa entre los dos. En ese sentido incluso si ella esta haciendo más por “la relación” no es necesariamente algo que concierna a la verdadera relación que tiene contigo. 
<br />

<br />
MITO: Las mujeres se involucran más en la relación, los hombres permanecen más distantes.
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Finalmente un mito que es verdad. La parte falsa de la afirmación es la que dice que están muy involucrado en la relación es algo bueno y que permanecer distante es fatal. Si tienes duda, dedícate a mirar y vas a ver como encontraras parejas en las cuales no hay mucho mas que hacer que sentarse, mirarse y darse cuenta como la relación se va a la mierda. Toda relación debe tener un balance entre la parte interna de cada uno y la parte externa o común. Muchas minas que se quejan de que sus novios no le dan mucha bola a “la relación” no están mirando la relación de una manera objetiva o están enterradas hasta el cuello en la relación y por ende creando más problemas de los que resuelven. 
<br />

<br />
Recientemente estaba mirando un libro del Dr. Laura y vi un capitulo que lo demuestra de buena manera. Dice que cuando un hombre manifiesta que le gustaría volver a la universidad a estudiar y la mina dice que le gustaría casarse, ella reclama enojada que el “no esta pensando en la relación”, que ella tiene automáticamente la razón cierto?
<br />

<br />
Pero esta decisión podría ser buena para ambos, por lo tanto las mujeres confunden “la relación” con un ambiente sano, considerando que la mitad del tiempo están pasándose películas. A veces tu relación necesita mas atención de la que le estas dando, otras veces ella exagera. El supuesto de que más involucramiento implica mas amor es totalmente falso. 
<br />

<br />
MITO: Cuando ella dice no, significa no (por que estoy tan confundido)?
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: No todo el mundo quiere decir “no” cuando dice “no”. Piensalo, tu lo haces? Nunca dijiste no cuando querias decir si? Nunca dijiste no cuando estabas nervioso, no sabias en que te metias y no tuviste tiempo para pensar tu respuesta? Nunca dijiste no por que creias que debias decir no aunque en realidad querías decir si? Nunca dijiste no y de ahí cambiaste de idea? Nunca dijiste no como broma, solo por joder, cuando realmente querías decir si?
<br />

<br />
He hecho todas esas cosas una y otra vez, la mayoría de los hombres lo ha hecho y se que muchas mujeres también. Eso si para los hombres hay una advertencia. Si ella es proclive a decir no cuando quiere decir si, mejor mándala a la mierda. De inmediato. Especialmente si te dice un no incierto y luego te tira pistas que supuestamente debes ignorar e ir por ella igualmente. Manda a la mierda a la puta. Es demasiado peligroso. Imagínate en la corte, acusado de violación “Ella le dijo no Señor Smith? – Si pero después ella trato de sacarme los pantalones y se sentó en mi cara!- Pero ella dijo no Señor Smith! – Mmmm si, ella dijo no- Caso Cerrado!”. 
<br />

<br />
Una vez salí con una que me dijo, en la segunda cita, que no había forma de que me acostara con ella, de que su ex vendría a visitarla y que seria “muy complicado” si la pillara durmiendo conmigo cuando el llegara. En nuestra tercera cita hizo todo lo posible para hacerme saber que quería coger, incluso se tiro en mi cama, hizo comentarios acerca de sacarse la ropa para que le hiciera un masaje desnuda. La lleve a su casa, la mande a la mierda y nunca mas salí con ella. Es una de las cosas más inteligentes que hice en mi vida. 
<br />

<br />
MITO: Las mujeres son genios sociales, todas las mujeres se llevan bien unas con otras, en cambio los hombres solo pelean. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: Viví en un departamento mixto por dos años en la universidad donde cada piso estaba separado por sexo. Un piso hombres, otro mujeres, otro hombres y así. Algunas residencias cercanas eran totalmente mixtas. Algunos pisos de hombres estaban hechos mierda, los hombres son un desastre. Los pisos de las minas se veían perfectos, todas las minas sonreían y eran amistosas. Eso si, si hablabas con ellas todas te decían que era horrible vivir en un piso de puras mujeres, y que estaban pensando cambiarse a un piso mixto el próximo año. Según ellas, detrás de la limpieza de las piezas habían garras y lenguas afiladas. Todos los días había una batalla social por detrás. Los hombres por otro lado se llevaban bien, salvo excepciones. La mayoría estaba feliz donde estábamos, la única queja era que no veíamos minas seguido. 
<br />

<br />
Otra cosa que es verdad de este mito, es que cualquier mujer defenderá a otra mujer contra un hombre, incluso si no conoce a la mina. Empieza a rajar a una mina que no esté en ese momento y vas a encontrar minas defendiéndolas incluso no teniendo idea de que pasa. Si una mina ataca a un hombre, otros hombres no van a saltar a defenderlo, por que? Porque los hombres que cada uno puede defenderse solo y al final ellos son competencia. Las mujeres creen que un ataque a una mujer es un ataque a todas las mujeres. 
<br />

<br />
MITO AMARGO: Son todas iguales. 
<br />

<br />
VERDAD: No todas las minas son iguales, y en particular, las minas cambian con la edad. Una mujer que no te dio bola a los 15 te puede pedir que salgas con ella a los 35. En parte se debe al “reloj biológico” y en parte al cambio en sus prioridades. A los 15 quiere impresionar a sus amigas, a los 25 quiere pasarla bien sin ataduras y quiere pulir sus habilidades controladoras. Quiere más estabilidad pero no quiere a Bill Gates. A los 35 se da cuenta que es tiempo de asentarse y ponerse seria. 
<br />

<br />
Los flacos aburridos y nerds que eran rechazados a los 15 pueden ser galanes a los 35. Los hombres maduran y crecen, aprenden a necesitar menos a las minas y aprenden a asentarse en una vida de soledad resignada la cual implica que se animen ya que no están necesitando algo que no pueden tener. Hay pocos flacos solteros sin historial de divorcio. Finalmente sus prioridades cambian, ya no le impresionan los “tipos malos” en motos con historial de detenciones. Sabe que a sus amigas ya no les impresiona eso, y esta más interesada en construir un nido que en impresionarlas. Por lo tanto, que ahora no tengas minas no implica que toda la vida vaya a ser así. Toma este dato de mi parte: Nunca tuve una cita en el colegio, tuve una novia por un año en la universidad y diez años después tenia que usar repelente de minas.<br /><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

hay algo que SEGURO es mentira y es que hay minas que estan dispuestas a darte una mano y no por &quot;arreglarte&quot; y manejarte, sino porque son buenas flacas. es MUUUY raro encontrarlas, pero existen

<br />
lo cierto es que si... media pila ocupate de tu vida y dejate de joder, totalmente de acuerdo
<br />

<br />
en mi caso, veo SIEMPRE que actuan como dice este chabon, pero... tambien veo flacas que tenian noviecitos, no los controlaban y se querian (esto en estapa amorcito... eso pasa despues) y estaban &quot;enamorados&quot; y no se comportaban a lo bitchie y tampoco se casaron (aun)
<br />

<br />
lo que si... son flacas que quieren como &quot;asentarse&quot; (es cierto) y los chabones nada de mltr y obviamente no son players sino universitarios, con su vida al dia y sin antecedentes de &quot;muchas flacas&quot; etc

La otra verdad es que existen dos relaciones para ellas: la cual en la que estas (la que existe entre tu y ella) y la que tiene ella en su cabeza. Recuerdas como las mujeres hablan y teorizan acerca de las “relaciones”? Bueno mucho de lo que define “nuestra” relación es realmente una colección de teorías y prejuicios de conversaciones pasadas con sus amigas y no tiene nada que ver con lo que realmente pasa entre los dos. En ese sentido incluso si ella esta haciendo más por “la relación” no es necesariamente algo que concierna a la verdadera relación que tiene contigo.

Recientemente estaba mirando un libro del Dr. Laura y vi un capitulo que lo demuestra de buena manera.

Otra cosa que es verdad de este mito, es que cualquier mujer defenderá a otra mujer contra un hombre, incluso si no conoce a la mina. Empieza a rajar a una mina que no esté en ese momento y vas a encontrar minas defendiéndolas incluso no teniendo idea de que pasa. Si una mina ataca a un hombre, otros hombres no van a saltar a defenderlo, por que? Porque los hombres que cada uno puede defenderse solo y al final ellos son competencia. Las mujeres creen que un ataque a una mujer es un ataque a todas las mujeres.</td>	</tr></table></center>

ajjajajajajaj, esto le pasó a un amigo mío la semana pasada!
<br />

<br />
Hay dos relaciones: A y B. Mi amigo A tuvo una discusión con su novia A porque un amigo nuestro B terminó la relación con su novia B, ella lo cagó en muchas cosas, la verdad bastante conchudita (también él no hizo las cosas bien y se dejó manipular). La relación A terminó re peleada porque la relación B termino, solo porque novia A defendió ciegamente a novia B jajajajja, cualquiera!
