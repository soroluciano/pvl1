<br />
Los voy a postear acá así no tienen que abrir el link (ya lo hicieron seguro jajajj), recuerden que los posts son de Badboy y de Comecuca, no son míos, espero que no les moleste que los ponga acá.

BADBOY
<br />

<br />
Being a player Its not only about going out and picking up hot girls. After a while you will get bored, sick of clubs.thats a time to start thinking about developing good social circle and start getting laid through social circle. Its easier, its more fun then going to clubs.
<br />

<br />
But, this is not a replacement method for going to clubs and picking them up, this is not a replacement for your fear of approaching. This is an Lifestyle upgrade after you develope good game. this is Next step you will do to get good with girls.
<br />
Badboy :“ I dont go to clubs anymore to get laid, my social circle can feed all my needs now.“
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
Social Circle Game</span>
<br />

<br />
As this game reguires different mindset and attitides then „Club game“ you will have to change and bend your beliefes, and behaviour to make it succesful.
<br />

<br />
Before you even start, you must get rid of that stupid PUA mindset *trying to fuck every girl in your life* That mindset is not compatible with Social Circle game. In social circle, there will be some hot girls, that you will not be allowed to touch. If you will be able control your desires, you will succeed.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
Rule 1# You must create female friends.</span>
<br />

<br />
I used to be a guy who would go to clubs and do everything to get those beautifull hot girls home and fuck them. Not anymore. Now I go to clubs and BEFRIEND that same hot girl that I used to pull home.Why? Because I know she has at least 5-7 hot friends. Nowdays I fuck those 5-7 friends, not that one girl. MIND Shift.
<br />

<br />
Every girl has a inner circle of 5 -7 girls. They are usually same looking as she is. If she is a 9' ( on scale of 1- 10) she will have friends who are in range on 8 – 10. Beautiful woman usually hang out with other beautiful woman. As they can relate to her problems, and her lifestyle. Be smart and pentrate into her social circle,
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
STEP 1 Go out</span>
<br />

<br />
Go out, find some hot girl approach her, get her phone number. Here you still do same thing as in normal pickup, build attraction, create wide and deep rapport and get her phone number. Do not Kiss her. Nothing sexual with her. Create lots of trust She is going to be your female friend .A bait to get other girls. Female friends you dont fuck
<br />

<br />
Few days later, call her, take her on date, do everything normal as girls you usually date, have fun with her you can even pay for everything it doesnt matter as you do not want to have sex with her. Try not to. There is going to be a moment, where Kiss will be in air.Moment, where normally you would kiss her. Now, you will miss that moment. Let this sexual energy between two og you dies. Behave and act as she is your friend, and she will be. You can even tell her: „ you know what, we are going to be a friends, I feel so good with you... we can talk about everything“.
<br />
Now you will be the one who is „ Lets Just Be Frkends“ her
<br />

<br />

<br />
\every hot girl dreams about having cool guy as a friend.Problem of hot girls is that every guy on this planet is trying to get into her panties. Every guy, besides you. You are different.Remember, you dont want her, you want her friends.
<br />
It will be very hard to stay cool around perfect 10 and not think about sex. Very few guys on planet are able to do somethig like that. And those few guys are blessed with beauty they get. In first few dates you have to show that you do not want to date her, but you want to be friends. Have a evening coffee with her, You have to Lets Just Be Friends her.Once you are there 50% of job is done.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
RULE #2 You don't eat your Bait</span>
<br />

<br />
When you go fishing, if you eat your bait... how do you plan to get fish with??
<br />
The bigger bait you have, the bigger FISH you going to get!!!
<br />
9's will attract 9's, 10s will attract 10's
<br />

<br />
You will have to spend some money on her. She will cost you. Take her out on dinner, movie. Spend some time and money on her. Treat her as you would treat good friend.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
Introduce her to your friends</span>
<br />

<br />
o gain more trust, organize some get together so she can meet your cool friends.Let she talks to her friends how you have cool guys they can meet. And then slowly start sucking her into your social life. Next Friday organize some get/together before going out to clubs. Girls usually meet for drinks 10/11 pm at some br, and then they go out. Let they meet at your place instead for glass of wine, and then all you can go to clubs.
<br />
First few times they wont trust you so your Bait girl will come with only one or 2 friends. Bring some cool guy.
<br />
Do not hit on your social circle, but neither to new girls in your life. Instead socialize with them. Let girls become relaxed in your house. Trust &amp; comfort.
<br />

<br />
Go to club with them, and give them FUN. Let they enjoy you
<br />
First 'party' let it be small, few of girls, few of guys.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
Rule 2 60% - 40% Ratio</span>
<br />

<br />
Or a good atmosphere there must be 20-30% more girls in a room.
<br />
Girls have to be in majority
<br />
For best parties, best atmosphere, ration of girls vs guys should be 60 % to girls and 40% guys. Girls have to be in majority. This way they will feel relaxed, and safe to do whatever they want.Choose cool guys who you hang out. You dont want Pickup artists in your social circle who will do „sets“ at your party. They will scare girls, and that will lead towards destruction of social circle.Girls will simply stop hanging out with you as they dont feel safe.
<br />

<br />
Make sure you male friends know, 'do not hit on them rule' -- educate your friends
<br />

<br />
Do not hit on them at first few parties, play cool male friends game. Your Bait girl has to be and feel like a queen. Fullfil ner needs. She will bring lots of hot girls to your house later on.
<br />
What do you want is to make those 15-20 girls so relaxed in your house, that they know they can get drunk, and nothing is going to happen ( no one is going to fuck them) ofcourse this trust is just an Illusion, as Harvest comes later.
<br />
At first few weeks, you have to play it as a Gay friends towars them.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
Rule 3# Keep the fridge always full</span>
<br />

<br />
You want to drink my wine?? You want to get some of girls we cultivated? No problem.But make sure sooner or later you bring Bootle of wine to replace it. Make sure as well to bring new girl to replace one you took/!
<br />
Fridge, must be always full, so everyone can feed themselves. Thats rule of thumb. All of my Male friends know it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
One thing I hate on parties, and that is those guys who come, and they think they can drink for free, girls that are in that room are for free.. etc
<br />
Its note like that. When guy comes to party he doesn't come with any girl, but has there to feed himself, try to not invite him again.
<br />
You don't need those kind of guys in your life.
<br />

<br />
Those guys do not understand, that every girl I hvae in my life( inner circle girl) costed me few hundreds bucks. ( indirect cost, dinners, phone calls, coffee)... all those things that makes her stay in your life.
<br />

<br />
Once you have good quality girls in your life, be careful with who do you share them. You have to share them, being selfish and keeping it all for yourself wont work as well. If you invite 15 girls at your party and its you alone there, it wont work, girls will dsmell whats happening. So you hae to share your circle with quality guys.
<br />
If you have top-quality guys ( your friends) on parties, that girls can meet, they will love to come back to you, as they know place where they can meet excellent guys.
<br />
Do not invite weirdo's, community guys. You want socially-calibrated guys, who are successful in their private life. Even better, get guys who have developed their circle as well.
<br />

<br />

<br />
This is long term plan, but fuck it, once you create this, there is enough girls for rest of your life.
<br />
I am sure you already know what I am talking about here, as at least you know one person who is doing exactly this.
<br />
The goal, is to get together with guys like that, and share and combine circles of groups.
<br />

<br />
In the end you want to have gather 3 baits who are 9's or 10's and get their corcle into your life. Each girl will get you 5 girls into your life. That means 3 X 5 = 15 hot girls.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
Your apartment/ house</span>
<br />

<br />
That is only place you control 100%
<br />
It has to be clean, smell nice. Get some cool music.print nice photos from your life, and put them in photoalbum, and leave it around.Girls love it.On bookshelf put some sex books.They will grab it sooner or later.
<br />
You will control energy of your private party, by drink you give them to drink, and music you play. Budha bar or cafe del mar is perfect for those kind of ebents, but be flexible. Let girls pplay music they like. Let them feel and behave as they are at home.
<br />
Get some good wine.2 botles of red and 2 of white wine. Wine will keep energy low. Shoots will make them aggresive.Learn how to make cocktails. You only have to know how to make 2 or 3 of them.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
Putting it all together
<br />
</span>
<br />
What I do every so and then, is I will call my baits ( female friends) to come at my place for drink before going out. Usually each of them brings one or 2 girlfriends. Some of them I met before some not. There are always some fresh girls coming into my life through circle. As Baits literally love me as a friend. I even one of them long time ago took to Paris on a business trip ( she paid 50% of expense). Even today she is talking about it. All her friends know how I took her to pariis, and didn’t tried to have sex with her. By doing it, now she is building indirectly lots of attraction for me. Her girlfriends feel attraction for me way before they even met me. When they come to my place, 50% of game is already done. They feel attraction, they trust me, as its social circle. I have to build some physical comfort and make it sexual. That’s it.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
I love this game!</span>
<br />

<br />
So they arrive to my place, and Bait 2 introduced me to her hot girlfriend from university. Yummy blond. I see she already heard all stories about me, and she likes me. She is my target for tonight I decided to take is slow with her. Just to create more trust and comfort with her and wait till end of night. We had some fun at my place, drank some wine, talked about XY, and went to club 12:30. I got us on guess list, so we didn’t waited in line.5 girls, 2 guys.
<br />
Inside club, we partied, had fun, and I was building massive rapport with my target. 3 am, we are all going home, and I told to whole group that I will drive my target to her home. whole group is fine, as we are friends. When we got to car, I asked her does she wants to have one more drink at my place ( she already been there few hours ago, so its not a problem). We got home. Started kissing, had sex. No one knew.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
Breaking up.</span>
<br />

<br />
Breaking up with one of girls from circle like walking on a thin ice. If break up was to hard core, or you are cheating one of girls and your social circle finds out that, there is a big chance you will lose girl and whole circle. They wont trust you anymore. I did a mistake like this, and whole corcle fall apart. So Be very careful how you end relationships. Best way is to “ Lets just be friends them”. Tell them, you think that you tried, but you feel this realationship wont work, or any other excuse. When breaking up use word FEEL a lot. “ I feel there is nothing between us” etc
<br />
If whole circle falls apart, don’t panic. Go out and find new bait, and start from scratch. It takes you around ¾ weekas to cultivate good social circle with 6/10 hot girls inside.

COMECUCA
<br />

<br />
The way I've built my social circle is by having lots of male, female friends and having a party circuit. My social circle consists of several tribes within a bigger social circle. I have 5 good friends and they have sisters, girlfriends, cousins, friends of sisters, friends of cousins, etc. The girlfriends and sisters of these 5 are off limits to my immediate group. All of the other ones are open game. Then there are tribes that consist of 5 or 6 good male friends which are cool with our own tribe and we have a symbiotic relationship with them. Their cool friends can fish in our pond and we can fish in theirs. I have about 4 tribes which are in contact with my own and the number seems to grow every couple of months.
<br />

<br />
The hub of this whole tribal system is the party circuit. Someone's always having a pool party, beach outing, pre-clubbing drinks, birthday party and any number of social activities. My tribe throws parties and the other tribes throw parties as well. Point of the matter is that there's always something going on and there's always access to new women. Each tribe operates independent from the others but constant contact is kept to keep the network of tribes close to eachother. Everyone is in charge of bringing new female recruits into the circle similar to how Badboy explained. Whenever we go out, our girls and guys invite women to hang out with our social circle. Once they get the ok from the whole tribe then they start bringing in their friends which means more and more women. Again, the only women in our tribe who are off limits are girlfriends and sisters. All the other ones are fair game.
<br />

<br />
When we have new, hot female recruits several things may happen. You either fuck this hot girl and keep her in the circle, fuck her and exclude her or nurture her as a friend so she brings her female friends around. Sometimes the new female recruits want to be exclusive with me or my friends and if she fits then she fits. If she doesn't then she doesn't. With some girls you can fuck their whole network of friends and with some girls you simply cannot because they're protective of one another. In the case of the former discretion is the key. You can fuck all of the girls but don't go blabbering about it because it can have a negative impact. In the case of the latter, the women are kept in so they could be fucked by others and bring in even more women.
<br />

<br />
I don't stop sarging and feed exclusively from my social circle. I use my social circle every now and again so that I don't overfish in my own waters. It is often better to go out and get your own women than relying solely on your social circle. It has been my experience that bringing in a new, hot girl into the circle affirms your status and makes the women within the circle take notice. Like I wrote above with the three possible outcomes, whenever I bring in a new woman I use my social circle to make her feel welcome. Our girls become friends with them and so on and so forth. The whole structure depends on the social activities which the circle affords to it's members. That's the glue that holds the bee hive together and keeps the good times rolling.
<br />

<br />
PUA's are welcome into my circle. Wanabe PUA's who are poachers are not. Everyone in my circle can get women and they have the rules of the tribe very clear. If anyone breaks them the consequences are swift and immediate. You're out. That's why I only keep 4 or 5 good friends around. These 4 or 5 guys are good with women and can be trusted to shut the fuck up when needed. Other tribes may not be made up by PUA's but then again they know we are PUA's and they hold us in pretty high regard. Regardless of this we still respect the sisters and girlfriends rule.
<br />

<br />
My social circle is not set up solely for getting women although the women are a huge fringe benefit. I don't view my social circle as huge pool of women although I can certainly use it for that. The most important role of the social circle is to make things easier for everyone in it. It is meant to give access to things we all want. To put it simply. Having many, many friends can help you more than not having them. I've made strong business connections as well as strong friendships within my social circle. Make a dude feel welcome and give him access to women and you have a friend for life. That's how my network of tribes work. Further, being good with women on your own gives you a huge leg up status-wise, which means even more access. It has been my experience that if a social circle is set up solely for getting women there's always jealousy and scarcity to contend with. My social circle is there to make life easier for everyone it period.
<br />

<br />
The easiest way to build a social circle is by being good with women. Recruit a group of friends who are also good with women and build a huge social network together. Going it alone is a pain in the ass. That's why social networks are called social networks.

Todo esto, me llevó a rearmar mis viejos círculos sociales. Ya estoy agregando chicas con las que tenía mucha confianza, estoy volviendo a conectar con viejos amigos... y todo esto no es solo por el hecho de garchar más minas, sino porque la amistad es algo que no tenés que dejar nunca de lado, y está re bueno.
<br />

<br />
Y bueno, ahora estoy hablando con una minita por msn y me dice que conoció un montón de pibes con los que sale o salió que eran de esos viejos círculos sociales. Poder manejar esto sería un poder supremo jojojoooo. Mis primeras dos novias las saqué por círculo social, y digamos que fue bastante fácil. Con esto te das cuenta que el PU es un recurso.
<br />

<br />
Esto me llevó a pensar también que... PVL tiene varios círculos sociales. O sea, ya de tantas salidas se formó un buen grupo, por lo menos en Bs As. Estaría bueno poder meter algunas minitas lindas para usarlas de carnada en nuestro grupo de salidas. OJO! son intocables, son para traer más minitas. Yo podría conseguir un par, mi prima es modelo y tiene amigas... NI SE LES OCURRA!!! ya se lo q están pensando guachos! jajajaj.
<br />

<br />
Fuera de joda, algo voy a tener que hacer con las amigas de mi prima jejej.
<br />

<br />
Un buen ejemplo de esto, es el FR de Styltop en el que salió con esa HB9,5 amiga que tiene, miren los caminos que le abrió esa minita. Imaginense tener 3 o 4 minas así en el grupo (intocables por supuesto), la cantidad de concha que nos van a proveer, y qué facil va a ser...
<br />

<br />
Sigan imaginando... jajaj
<br />

<br />
Saludos!
<br />

<br />
NOTA: Acá si le doy el visto bueno al MM, diría que es la mejor opción (o la más completa) para armar círculos sociales. Por lo que leí en algún lado, la gran mayoría de las que Mystery garcha fueron de círculos sociales.<br /><br />_________________<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Si solo sabés de seducción, no sabés nada de seducción</span>

Tal como quoteo NR, es muy importante tener la capacidad de gamearte minitas para que estén al lado tuyo no como huesitos, sino como &quot;amigas&quot; x mas que nos guste, nos exite, tenga buenas tetas o lo que sea. 
<br />

*Entrar a un boliche de la mano de una pendeja linda no tiene precio!!
<br />

<br />
*Que las minas te vean abrazados, riendote, pasandola bien con vos tampoco tiene precio!!
<br />

<br />
Yo ultimamente, estoy dedicando (perdiendo) noches de games, para lograr ingresar a un determinado circulo social que ahí para mi está el &quot;click&quot; del asunto. Ya ayer, en el boliche fui con estos tipos grosos, y si bien no kclossie con ninguna debido a q me la pasé con los vagos rompiendo las pelotas(rompí mi racha de 8 asaltos seguidos)  y me hice muy amigo de estos vagos y me bailé muchos temas con las minitas de &quot;speed&quot; que estaban en el grupo a miradas de otras minas que estoy seguro q me ficharon y si el sab. me les quiero acercar, voy a arrancar desde mas arriba a que si no me hubieran vistoooo..
<br />

<br />
Asiq muchachos, no descuiden el &quot;social circle&quot; porq para mi entender, es una de las cosas mas interesantes de las dinámicas sociales y que es una plantita, ya que los beneficios se ven a largo plazo pero vale la pena cultivarlaaaaaa!!

A mi personalmente Me cuesta mucho tener amigas mujeres con las que no pase nada, salvo las novias de amigos. 
<br />

<br />
Yo por ej, siempre, apenas empiezo a gamear, trato de empezar haciendo sociales con tipos, y desde que gameo esto cambió mucho. Me dí cuenta que si no estoy encarando, lo mejor es igual hablar con cualquiera. cualquiera. Además es mucho más facil hacer sociales con los tios que con las minas.
