				<td colspan="2" class="postbody">The Transition to Natural Game (Part Two)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Current trends in seduction favor a more genuine and natural framework driven by confidence and a strong assumption of attraction. It seems the highly canned routine-based game initially designed for ego preservation is giving way to a more integrated and free-flowing approach. This warrants an in-depth codification of the process of transitioning to a natural game that is both highly effective in-field and consistently teachable. 
<br />
My recent work has been not only to identify those concepts which drive Natural Game, designing applicable mindsets and techniques, but to also develop a systematic method for students, no matter what their background, to make the transition to Natural Game. Despite my use of the term ‘Natural Game’ it is a mistake to assume that it’s sufficient to ‘just be cool’, ‘act normal’ or ‘be yourself’. Given the highly ambitious scope of becoming a full-blown Pick up Artist, a systematic approach is, in most cases, NECCESSARY to ensure optimum development of the correct behaviors and beliefs. 
<br />
This article aims to deal with three high level and large-frame concepts which serve as a foundation for a highly practical and field-tested method which preserves the inherent attractiveness and integrity of the student. All great pickup artists have internalized these concepts to the point of automaticity, whether they know it or not. Misattributing the source of their power, a number of good pick-up artists spend too much valuable time emphasizing axillary skills such as storytelling, humor and random gimmickry. While these skills may serve as useful tools for specific situations, they are of limited application and not entirely relevant to the matter at hand. 
<br />
I believe it is highly beneficial to cut straight to the true essence of success, leaving yourself the option of developing into a great storyteller or comedian later on, if that is your inclination. In that case, development of Natural Game concepts will constitute a robust foundation invaluable for whatever style suits your personal taste. Our primary role as pickup artists is the successful connection with and seduction of women. That will be the focus of this article. 
<br />
The three base concepts for discussion are: 
<br />
1. Spontaneity Over Structure
<br />
2. Mutual Value Escalation
<br />
3. Congruence to Intention 
<br />
If you haven’t read The Transition to Natural Game part I, authored by myself, you may want to do that first. I might also add that the newly revised Razorjack Method is 100% compatible with this text. 
<br />
Spontaneity over Structure 
<br />
Spontaneity is the characteristic of creating an experience with optimum emotional capacity to the exact situation at hand. (Or very appropriately termed your ‘Pimp Brain’ by PlayerSupreme) 
<br />
It is that time when you were totally *ON* - joking with the girl, laughing with her, sharing, you had so much you could talk about, so much you wanted to share. You told her stories, and made jokes about things in the environment, teased her, related to her… If you’ve never experienced this, well… keep reading! 
<br />
Spontaneity is not what you have never said or done before, but a new combination of the thousands of things you have already experienced. We all have a realm of experiences from which to draw via an associative process. Rather than rehearsing memorized content, you are re-experiencing images from memory and recounting the experiences into the here and now with a fresh touch to it. Your amplification or elimination of certain details allows you to custom tailor your presentation and ultimately the entire shared experience to her personality type. 
<br />
Spontaneity is a state where all of the relevant neural pathways are active such that you have instant access to associated memories. You are extroverted and aware of your environment. You are completely unattached to outcomes, and completely IN the moment. Not focused on the process, you ARE the process. Your experience is that very moment, not stuck in the two minutes ago, but in the PRESENT. 
<br />
It is that freshness. That presence. Are you THERE in the moment with the girl? Are you seeing her for who she really is? Are you more present in the moment than her husband? Then she is yours. 
<br />
You are crafting an emotional experience based on the instantaneous moment in which you and the girl reside. Spontaneity can be developed to such a degree that your improvised conversation is more fresh, genuine and attractive than anything you could have prepared prior. This is because it is born out of the moment, and is highly relevant. The freshness and energy which spawns from spontaneity is a powerful and complete value demonstration in itself. 
<br />
Can you discard your routines and structure at the drop of a hat, when an opportunity to live in the moment presents itself? 
<br />
Or do you sacrifice the opportunity because of attachment to a predetermined script? 
<br />
Spontaneity is of utmost importance. More than anything, women will feel great rapport with you based on your degree of spontaneity. Women spend all of their lives searching for that guy who can VIBE. The guy who’s energy matches her’s - when they are together the interaction just HITS! Women always ask themselves things like “How do I feel around him?”, “How natural does it feel?”. When you create a spontaneous interaction with a girl, she will be absolutely convinced that you are her soulmate. If you can connect in that manner, she will forget all other objections about you, and be completely in love. This is paramount in making those super-fast lays happen. 
<br />
Anything that feels forced, rehearsed or planned KILLS the interaction. Even guys that have great routines or are great storytellers possess spontaneity. There still needs to be a good interaction flow between the stories… AND for when the stories run out! Resist getting stuck trying to correct mistakes made beforehand, stay in the moment - the river keeps on flowing! Persistence and spontaneous creation of context in part comes from having strong beliefs, but you can train yourself to develop those beliefs by maintaining a continuous flow of action. 
<br />
I recently heard a really good quote from Harmless. He said “The guys that are great - they can take nothing… and turn it into something.” What is he talking about? Spontaneous creation of experience based on circumstance. Nothing else. Taking what little is available and creating CONTEXT for interaction. 
<br />
Another benefit to spontaneity is the byproduct development of situational relevance. Strongly correlated to social intelligence, situational relevance is an intuition that determines when certain routines are appropriate in a given context. Some guys run routines that are completely irrelevant to the situation at hand. They never took the time to develop their spontaneity and now have zero sense of whether their routines are appropriate or not. Even the coolest, most bad-ass routine will fall flat if delivered in an inappropriate situation, or prematurely. 
<br />
Training your mind for spontaneity is the process of conditioning your mind to develop instantaneous association recall. Development of any skill is proceeded by a strong stimulus to the neurology which facilitates that said skill. It is analogous to weightlifting - you lift weights which provides your muscles a powerful stimulus, and they respond by becoming stronger and more developed. 
<br />
From a strictly mental viewpoint, it is very much like learning a language. A friend of mine took four years of Spanish in high school and a few years later could speak nothing of the language. She then took a two week vacation with her boyfriend in Puerto Rico, and came back speaking near fluent Spanish. Putting yourself in a situation over and over with little preparation gives the strongest stimulus to that part of your brain which you aim to develop. 
<br />
Overpreparation in the form of learning too many pickup lines or routines will circumvent that process. It’s like using crutches for your whole life with the expectation of developing strong legs. It just won’t happen. For this reason, I am a huge proponent of minimizing the number of routines you take with you into the field. 
<br />
Developing spontaneity in a nutshell: 
<br />
1. Go into the field unprepared
<br />
2. Approach a woman with a specific intention (We’ll learn this in section 3)
<br />
3. Persist as long as possible congruent to your chosen intention
<br />
4. 4. Repeat the process for a balanced variety of situations 
<br />
Little preparation, strong sexual intent, lots of persistence… Sounds like Gunwitch Method to me! This may explain the great success of everyone who applies GWM. It is an excellent foundation and perfect for building that very important trait we call SPONTANEITY. 
<br />
We are training WARRIORS of pickup. We produce guys who can trust their instincts in any situation and WIN. Their subconscious is trained to make superb decisions in microseconds. They recall highly relevant stories to tell their women, they crack just the right joke at the right time, and they know exactly which emotions need to be projected to capture her SOUL. 
<br />

<br />
Mutual Value Escalation 
<br />

<br />
Mutual value escalation has been the driving force behind most of the successful techniques and methods developed in history and recent years. It is also the concept which drives most symbiotic relationships between living things. A mutual value escalation is is an interaction which results in an financial / emotional / intellectual exchange in which both parties benefit. A coach makes his players sharper, faster, and able to think more quickly on their feet and in turn they go on to win games and championships for him. Their combined value as a team is much greater than the sum of their value as individuals. 
<br />
Certain people are more inclined to escalating value than others. As pick up artists, it is of utmost importance. It can be said that there are three types of people in this world: Givers, takers and leaders. 
<br />
‘Givers’ give everything away up front, with a hidden expectation of return. If they do not get that return, they harbor expressed or unexpressed anger and hostility. The classic example of this is the ‘nice guy’ who supplicates over and over expecting to get sex in return, and then when he gets dumped, blames the girl and calls her a bitch. MVE is NOT supplication. It is the preservation and enhancement of overall or long term collective emotions of a group of people. When a ‘giver’ gives something (with expectation of return) then you will then be holding the ‘expectation’ emotion, and the girl will now be carrying a ‘obligated / accountable’ emotion. Neediness also causes these types of emotions. That is mutual value degradation. 
<br />
‘Takers’, realizing that ‘givers’ get nowhere in our society, take as much as they can from people because of their own insecurity about their abilities to attain what they desire. They also will harbor anger and hostility if they do not get what they attempt to take. A good example is a guy (who some may consider ‘alpha’) who tries to extract sex or financial resources from a woman but adds absolutely no value to her life. These guys will be successful to a certain extent with low self esteem women, but eventually smart women will grow tired of this and conjure up enough strength to break free from such an unhealthy and destructive relationship. The relationship ends with both parties worse off than when they started, both with a distorted perception of the opposite sex. 
<br />
Both ‘givers’ and ‘takers’ come from a similar place. They are both attached to an outcome and attempt to use negative emotions in order to reach that outcome. The hostility and anger originates from the fear of an imagined consequence resulting from failure to ‘take’ or ‘receive’. 
<br />
What most people fail to notice, however is that there is another option: The Leader. A leader will increase the value of himself all the while increasing the value of the people he interacts with. He makes intelligent decisions, takes responsibility for his actions and creates positive emotions in his group. Since the majority of people in this world fall into the ‘giver’/'taker’ category, it is the leaders who, through their strength and direction, can rise above and make things go right. It is commonly thought that there can only be one leader in any interaction. That is not true. It may be true that only one person can leading at any one particular time, but two leaders can interact in a very effective and mutually beneficial manner. 
<br />
I really think people have a huge misconception about indirect methods. They seem to believe we are somehow ‘hurting’ the girl or making her feel bad about herself in some way. When done correctly, this cannot be further from the truth. Great C+F is giving her the gift of humor. Well constructed negs demonstrate awareness and social subtlety, valuable to any woman striving to be more beautiful. Well timed takeaways teach women to respect us, and in the end they appreciate the lesson. 
<br />
If your methods do not add value to the interaction, then you are coming from the wrong place. Escalate mutual value, always. 
<br />
Most healthy men and women have a tendency toward survival and the attainment of positive emotions. People naturally want to be around others who can add value to their lives and make them feel good. It is completely natural and built into us by evolution. Natural leaders take care of themselves, they involve themselves in actions to improve their lives, and the lives of the people around them. It just plain feels GREAT to be around people who possess this quality. They are charismatic, comfortable and inspire everyone involved to more positive and pleasurable emotions. 
<br />
Mutual Value Escalation is THE way into the secret society. By your actions, you demonstrate that a woman’s involvement in your life would only be a benefit to her, no matter what your intention is. You leave absolutely no room for implications of negative repercussions. Since leaders have no attachment and make no implied demands, women will very quickly realize the potential of a no-strings-attached sexual relationship as well as a fulfilling and rewarding long term relationship. 
<br />
We are not the guys who impose on their freedom by dropping hints of emotional dependence. We do not supplicate to a woman and shower her with insincere compliments. We are also not the guys who, in a selfish pursuit of our own hedonism, sabotage her emotions with lies, deceit and invalidation. We do not drain the life energy from social interactions by demoralizing the team players on which we depend to enhance our lives. 
<br />
We strive to improve our women’s lives by helping them to become stronger, more independent, guiding her to self-discovery and excellence. 
<br />
And for that, they will reward us with everything they’ve got! 
<br />
Enhance her experience whether it is day game or night game, ‘indirect’ or ‘direct’ game. A lot of stock routines are created with value built in, so in a sense most of us are creating value escalation artificially. Be aware of the large frame of what we are doing and pay attention to the emotional implications of your technique. We are enhancing the shared experience of which we take part. MVE can be cultivated internally without routines, if you are aware of it while developing spontaneity. If you prefer to use straight spontaneity, only calling on stories when you are reminded of them, your intention will guide your language. Combine genuine expression with leadership frames so that you both benefit. 
<br />
Learn to reframe everything into the more positive, optimistic, humorous - But this doesn’t mean kiss her ass by any stretch. Be realistic and judge her shortcomings fairly. Be aware of her shortcomings, (don’t lie and tell her the opposite is true) but make her feel better about them. This is the base structure of good c+f or a great neg. 
<br />
The real power behind most great techniques is AWARENESS. Do you have the awareness to notice the subtle flaws and insecurities in a gorgeous woman, or are you perceiving her as perfect in every way, and merely picking out some random feature to criticize? In this game, cleverness is no substitute for true awareness. 
<br />
EXAMPLE: 
<br />
* Be aware and notice her shortcoming: She’s a bit short for your tastes
<br />
* Be honest with yourself about it, don’t lie to her: Don’t tell her she’s the perfect height if you don’t believe it
<br />
* Reframe it to positive in an attempt to make her feel better about it: 
<br />
Low degree of subtlety (C+F style): Tell her it must be nice to be able to get the child’s admission price into theme parks. 
<br />
High degree of subtlety (Neg style): Tell her you think she might look really great in high heels. 
<br />
The success of an approach is especially dependent on MVE. It is important to start with a leader vibe from the very beginning and presented as an opportunity for the two of you make a great connection. 
<br />
Taker’s approach: Either forced, too cocky, or too presumptuous. These guys may attempt to make women feel guilty for not talking to them. 
<br />
Giver’s approach: Weak, and full of compliments. These guys will just tell her she’s beautiful with hopes of her continuing the interaction. They expect that the simple act of giving a compliment will inspire her to chase them. 
<br />
Great approaches, no matter what the technique have a vibe that says “This is an opportunity for you to have a valuable interaction.” 
<br />
The direct approach presents a unique challenge since it is very common for the inexperienced practitioner to vibe ‘giver’ when using a compliment-type opener. He must rely on projecting value through his vibe, as opposed to having it built into the opener as is more common with opinion opener / story type openers. 
<br />
One of most challenging approaches from a logistical standpoint is opening a woman who is walking away from you. It requires a high level of physical awareness and playfulness. Any ‘taker’ vibe must be IMMEDIATELY diffused by increasing your distance, or by using humor. If you can do this well, pat yourself on the back. It requires a very subtle balance of different vibes, and opening with correct bodylanguage and timing. 
<br />

Congruence To Intention 
<br />

<br />
An intention is your underlying purpose and role in a woman’s life. An intention can take many forms. You can be anything from the guy who helps her with her math homework to the knight in shining armor who sweeps her off of her feet and changes her life forever. There are many different intentions, and it is the pick up artist’s job to: 
<br />
1. Familiarize yourself with the most common and effective intentions
<br />
2. Decide which intention is most relevant to a given situation
<br />
3. Congruently execute your chosen intention via a continuous flow of action 
<br />
The two most common intentions are ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’. A direct intention is one in which you express genuine interest in a girl from a place of higher value. You would then continue to reassure her of this all along the way, and treat her as if she is very special and unique. An indirect intention is one in which your interaction with a girl is purely social: Your interest lies mainly in something besides her. Maybe you are talking to her just to get an opinion, or maybe you are bored - or maybe you love the sound of your own voice! 
<br />
Keep in mind the two are not mutually exclusive. When it comes down to it, everyone uses both of them, as it is completely natural to use both of them. In fact, a great pick up artist should be familiar with each and be able to use them both with equal competence. To limit oneself to a single intention, is much like an actor who limits himself to playing only one type of character throughout his entire career. The skill of a great actor is not choosing a single great role, but his ability to climb deep into any given role - the ability to become congruent to an intention. 
<br />
Here’s an example: Entering a club, you may see a group of girls, not exactly your type, but still somewhat attractive. You may chat with them in a social way, while waiting for your friends. Later on in the night, you may catch a glimpse of a beautiful, stunning woman - and you express your interest to her. You have created attraction using two different intentions. ‘Direct’ guys use an ‘indirect’ intention all the time with girls they have no romantic interest in - and it may result in those girls chasing them. On the flipside, great ‘indirect’ practitioners shift to a direct intention the moment they qualify the girl - and they may spend the rest of the sarge using the direct intention! 
<br />
If you look at a ‘natural’ who does really well on a nighttime scene like a bar or club: How does he behave? Generally he will have a great time, enjoy the moment for what it is worth and spread his positive vibe to others around him. Women will gravitate toward these guys, and find them very attractive in this environment. Does this mean that ‘party’ guys are universally more attractive? Of course not. But people who go out to bars and clubs are going out to party for the evening, and the behavior of a party guy is highly congruent to that context. The natural is familiar with the environment and the types of interactions that go on during the course of the night. His behaviors are therefore congruent to both his intention and the shared intention of the groups he interacts with. If a natural gets up and walks away from a girl who isn’t cooperating, it is because his intention is to have a good time, and not chase any one particular girl. 
<br />
When one speaks of a ‘natural’, we talk about those guys who were born with those traits desirable to women. What exactly is the base characteristic that makes them so attractive? Is it their high energy? Is it their relaxed bodylanguage? Is it their boldness and honesty? 
<br />
No. 
<br />
It is their congruence to intention. Unlike a pick-up artist who has consciously designed his game from the ground up, a true ‘natural’ has little ability to make conscious choice of his intention. But the intention that he DOES have - he is DAMN congruent to it. 
<br />
Development of Natural Game is the development of the fundamentals that empower you to choose your intention based on the situation at hand, and remain congruent to that chosen intention. Remaining congruent to an intention means to continually interact with a girl in a way that reinforces your original intent, or serves to further define it. 
<br />
Congruence is the antithesis of coming across fake or ingenuine. In this game, to be labeled fake or ingenuine is the kiss of death! As men, we are expected to be strong decision makers, unwavering and ready to take action. Women are drawn to men who already know their place not only in the world but more importantly in her life. Make all of your subsequent actions congruent to your original intention. 
<br />
Congruence has the ability to create massive amounts of attraction in a woman - much more than any given part of the interaction. Women are not as imperceptive as we once thought them to be! Subsequent interaction increases attraction and rapport simultaneously to the extent that it is congruent with all previous interaction, and serves to further define your intention. Through congruency, you will amplify your value exponentially with each consecutive action you take. Therefore, a complete method of seduction is only effective to the extent that it is congruent within itself. 
<br />
To a woman, the fact that congruence creates attraction is very obvious. A woman would simply call it “being a real man”. Women don’t want to waste their time with men who cannot make decisions, do not understand themselves or do not understand how to relate to her. Lack of congruence leads to confusion, and people deal with an excess of confusion by becoming indifferent to it, or by escaping from it. The former will put you into the friends zone, and the latter will cause you to be blown out or cause a woman to flake on you.
<br />
It is not any particular intention which makes you attractive. It is your congruence to it. Again IT IS NOT any particular method which is superior to others. It is your belief, conviction and loyalty to THAT METHOD. If you master the art of maintaining congruence to intention, a whole new world of freedom and opportunity will open up to you, as you will now be able to make ANY method or technique work. 
<br />
A useful tool for familiarizing yourself with a particular intention is called Intention Mapping. It is also useful if you wish to create your own intention or ‘method’ of seduction. What most successful methods actually do is teach you to be very congruent to a single intention, through learning behaviors and techniques. Start by developing an idea of what kind of role you would like to play in a woman’s life. Would you like to be lover who changes her life forever, a guy with whom she has casual sex with a few times a month, or perhaps the guy she encounters for a single night of lust and passion? 
<br />
Intention maps are most effective when they match what a girl is ready for in this particular time in her life. In other words, your intention should be included in her realm of what is possible. While all women are different in the way they view the world, themselves and what is possible romantically, as a general rule you may find: 
<br />
* She’s single -&gt; Primarily open to romance and genuine interest from a guy
<br />
* She’s with a boyfriend or husband for security, or just out of a relationship -&gt; Primarily open to sexual variety, which may lead to romance later on
<br />
* She’s in an emotionally and sexually fulfilling relationship -&gt; Toughest case, but generally open sexual variety or romance from a guy who exhibits MVE 
<br />
After you determine the role you would like to play in a woman’s life, the next step is to fill in parts of the interaction with behaviors that are all congruent to the initial intention, and serve to further define it. 
<br />
There are basically two main intentions. Direct and Indirect. Here are some guidelines for these. 
<br />
Notes about the direct intention: 
<br />
When opening, many guys have a fear about expressing their interest in girl before knowing that she is attracted first. They believe that they shouldn’t let a girl know they like her, unless she has first indicated her interest. Ironically, it is that very belief which causes the lack of attraction. The reasoning of “Don’t show your intention because if you show your intention she can reject you.” can hurt you in some instances. The very act of demonstrating your true intention is what generates the attraction which prevents her from rejecting you in the first place! 
<br />
When with a wingman, rolling off for a lonewolf, (unless you have a good explanation for why you rolled off of your friend) you MUST get a quick number. In most cases a faster number will be more solid because it’s congruent to you hanging out with your friend! If you stay around and wait to ‘build rapport’, it will be incongruent with you being out with your friend, and it will also demonstrate negative things about your character. 
<br />
This is in contrast to you hunting alone (and not appearing to be in a hurry to a meeting, class etc…) getting a quick number is incongruent with the direct intention. If you are alone, and you meet a woman, push it as far as the limitations of logistics will allow before getting her number. 
<br />
The direct intention is mostly projected through bodylanguage, vibe and tonality. In other words, teasing her in a warm and reassuring way will NOT break your intention. It should be done in a way that is still congruent to your original intent of being genuinely interested in her. In fact, joking with her should serve to demonstrate your comfort together, NOT to invalidate her. 
<br />

<br />
If you chat with a girl in a very direct manner, and show her you will not just leave her to chat up some other chick - that you are with her and HER ALONE… If you show her that you are honest about your intentions to her, and that you genuinely think she’s special, you will have created a huge advantage over other players in the club, with that particular girl. There is strength in confidence. Your confidence in her will translate into her confidence in YOU. Often times, a strong direct intention will bypass a lot of complications such as AMOGs, obstacles and apparent logistical limitations. 
<br />
I’m not talking about forwards and backwards merging (entering other sets as a couple) this stuff is fine since the frame puts the two of you ‘together’ talking to ’strangers’. This is congruent with a direct intention. 
<br />
In my opinion, a successful pick up artist MUST become familiar and adept at projecting the direct intention. It is THE thing which separates pick-up artists from other players in the club. 
<br />
Notes about the indirect intention: 
<br />
Indirect intention is good for bypassing certain societal roadblocks. It is especially useful when a group of girls is already convinced you have lower value then they do, when your target girl knows you already have a girlfriend or two, or when you wish to attract a girl who you work with or go to school with. 
<br />
Next time you are about to use a routine to elevate your value or generate attraction, do not consider its standalone value. Instead, consider the congruence that routine has to your original intention. Does it reinforce your intention, increasing attraction and rapport, or does it deviate from your intention, decreasing attraction and rapport? Does each subsequent routine further define your intention, or does it serve to confuse a girl? 
<br />
With an indirect intention, a girl will have a lot of reservations about sex and generally exhibit a bit of last minute resistance. Backturns and takeaways are the most congruent way to handle this type of thing. If you start reassuring her in a direct way, she will not believe it, and you will come across weak. Using a more direct game without a lot of social proof, having generated attraction based on confidence and body language alone, it is not so important to take additional actions to convince her she is legitamitely special. You have already done so, and the fact that you are not chatting up three other women in the club reinforces that. 
<br />
If you would like to convert the relationship from casual one to a more romantic one, continue to have sex with her regularly (1-2 times per week at the least). The repeated sex will result in emotional attachment. 
<br />
Intention Shifting 
<br />
While staying congruent to these specific intentions, there is also some degree of flexibility. While is is best to avoid shifting intentions back and forth throughout the interaction, there are two common points where intention can be shifted without major repercussion. I would recommend learning how to handle both intentions very thoroughly before incorporating a shift into your game. The two points that serve as viable shifting points are Qualification and Conversion. Qualification is when you give her a statement of interest. Conversion is after you have had sex with her a few times such that she doesn’t write it off as a one night stand. (Usually between 2-4 times) 
<br />
If you start indirect, you can shift to direct when you qualify the girl. Stay direct until you successfuly convert the girl. Starting out with a very social game with heavy social proof, it becomes very important to convince the girl you like her for a valid reason. That is why you must screen her and qualify her based on that. 
<br />
If your interaction starts off direct, you can switch to indirect after you have successfuly converted her. Direct interactions have less of a tolerance for breaking congruency than indirect ones, so is wise to make sure the conversion is thorough. She must become physically attached to you, through repeated sex. 
<br />
Every successful pick up artist I have ever met has these concepts internalized. They may not be aware of it, but they’ve got them. Understand that these three concepts aren’t the end all be all of developing Natural Game, but they are a great place to start!
<br />

<br />
Value is of utmost importance in your interactions with women. It determines how willing a woman is to meet up with you, it determines a woman’s level of physical attraction for you, and ultimately, value determines how far a woman will go just to be in your life. Naturally, I get many questions from people asking me how they can increase their value: “Do I raise my value through DHV storytelling, do I lower her value through negs and indifference or do I use push / pull or what?” 
<br />
Firstly you must realize that value is almost entirely based on perception. That’s right. The only value that actually exists is inside the minds of the people around you. Sure there are things that society says is valuable, like how much money you make or what kind of car you drive, and based on society’s perception, some level of value can be assigned to people. But it is still just perception. What I am going to present to you today is a fundamental model of value. What I mean is, this model determines the effect that other value-shifting techniques will have when they are used. Value shifters like stories containing DHV spikes and negs as well as social value cues like cocky humor and peacocking are all subject to this fundamental concept. 
<br />
This means that all of the abovementioned techniques will work perfectly when you have this fundamental concept down, and will fall absolutely flat if you do not. How compliance relates to value 
<br />
First let me steal a term from Sinn of Mystery Method. The term compliance is used to measure the willingness a girl has to do something with you or for you. Sinn tells me this concept has replaced what used to be known as ‘hoop theory’. Sinn has also written an article called ‘Negative Compliance Momentum’ wich is definitely worth checking out. In short, getting a girl to talk to you when you approach her requires some level of compliance. Getting a girl to buy you drink requires a little bit more compliance, and of course getting a girl to the point where she is open to having sex with you requires even more. Compliance is directly proportional to value. The higher your perceived value, the more compliance you will naturally get from a woman. The higher you perceive a woman’s value, the more compliant you will be to her, automatically. 
<br />
Let me illustrate the fundamental nature compliance has with relation to value. If you tell a story about something off-the-wall that happened when you were chillin’ at the Playboy Mansion, it can quite potentially be a demonstration of higher value. Let’s say you use this Playboy Mansion DHV, but then she tests you by asking you to hold her drink while she dances, and you oblige. Your entire story is now negated. Since compliance is more fundamental than a story, she is perceiving your value based on the former. If instead of holding her drink, you instead explain that you might meet up with her later, then you would have been congruent and retained the value from the story. In fact, you could have been having a conversation with her about the mating patterns of the blue-jay in New England, and you would still have higher value. The Value-Compliance relationship is fundamental. 
<br />
Here is where it gets interesting. The compliance scales are different for men and women. Typically, men seek compliance based in replication value. That is, they are out to get a woman’s sexual value. They want to be close to a woman, touch her, kiss her and have sex with her. Women on the other hand, seek compliance based in survival value. Traditionally, women have urges toward getting protection, shared living space, and financial support from men. In fact, if you look at the nearly extinct paradigm of dating and marriage, and make two bars representing a man and a woman’s compliance scales, the relationship becomes very clear. (Fig. 1a) 
<br />

<br />
Here I have made two bars, each representing a man and woman’s relative values. The height of the bar represents their perceived value. (The man and woman have equal value in this diagram) The tick marks along the side represent the levels of compliance that are available for each person. In this diagram, the man has potential to get sex from the woman, and the woman has potential to get marriage from the man. 
<br />
I know some of you are laughing as you realize that most women don’t wait until marriage to have sex. That’s fine. This model is just an illustration of the compliance scales of men and women that everyone can relate to. We’ll get into some common scenarios and practical application a little later. Actually, this diagram is rather generous. In our society, the issue is further confused by the idea that a man must ‘win over’ a woman with a diamond ring in order to marry her - A frame of mind like that leaves a man with such little perceived value! 
<br />
Keep in mind, the actual compliance levels are quite arbitrary. I have labeled them for illustration, but in general just remember that a woman seeks compliance related to her immediate survival and the immediate survival of her family, while a man seeks compliance related to genetic survival and accessing a healthy, beautiful woman’s genes through sex. So we will see women chasing things like emotional strength, leadership and wealth, and we will see men chasing things like pretty faces and hot bodies. Evolution has created this situation for us. 
<br />
Mutual Compliance Escalation When a man and a woman meet, and become involved with each other, they take turns being compliant to each other. 
<br />
A man approaches a woman, she in turn gives him attention and talks to him. He asks her a few questions to screen her, she then complies and answers. He complies by qualifying her with a nice compliment. He asks her to go window shopping with him and she agrees, etc. On and on you go until you have reached full compliance from the woman. Unfortunately most men never even achieve full compliance from a woman, yet surrender their own full compliance all the time. It is a common mistake to believe that the more compliance you give, the more you will get from a woman and the more she will be attracted to you. 
<br />
So, a man and a woman go back and forth escalating compliance in a mutual way from one rung of the ladder to the next. You can see it illustrated in Fig 1b: 
<br />
Keep in mind this is not to be confused with Mutual Value Escalation, which instead means raising the levels of both of your value bars relative to the people around you via leadership, future adventure projections, teamwork / role playing frames and dominance over others. In order to move to the next level of compliance, two things are necessary. Firstly, you need perceived value of at least the same level or higher than the girl. Your value creates attraction and a willingness to comply. The second thing you need is comfort and trust. After all, women don’t go around sleeping with every guy that has higher value than them. 
<br />
The purpose of comfort and trust is so the girl feels safe knowing that the compliance escalation will continue after her current action. Both of these are needed in proportion to the level of the request you are making. Being compliant to her requests is one way of developing comfort and trust, but it is recommended to only comply with small requests that you don’t mind fulfilling. Hold off on complying to the large requests at first, since it has potential to be quite detrimental to your value. Take your time with the escalation and be sure to go through the full process of screening and qualification (both false and genuine). Attraction is the result of withheld compliance. Whatever compliance a girl feels she deserves but doesn’t yet have, produces attraction to you, the source of value. Screening and qualification is what makes her feel as though your compliance is worth pursuing. The best way to engage a girl, therefore is to demonstrate high value and produce relevant qualification. 
<br />
A couple other things are worth mention. Asking a person to do something, and having them reject you puts your value into flux. (We’ll talk about value flux a little later, when we discuss application) When a person declines your compliance request, it is not necessarily because they perceive your value as being low it it usually just because they aren’t sure what your value is yet. Look at a rejection as an opportunity. When your request is rejected, your value is in flux, and it is an opportunity for you to define it with your subsequent actions. 
<br />
For instance, if you go to kiss a girl, and she rejects you, it’s not necessarily because she perceives your value as being low. It is simply because she’s not sure. If you go and try to kiss her again, right away, you may lose some points with her. If you get angry or upset, or otherwise deflated or thrown off your game, you will certainly lose value. If, on the other hand you are cool and nonchalant about it, or you humorously tease her and joke about it, your perceived value will increase. At that point, you can safely try again at a later time and your chances of getting the kiss will have improved. Orbiters and Let’s Just Be Friends (LJBF) 
<br />
Let’s look at the special case where the man has lower perceived value than the woman. (Fig. 2a) 
<br />
Notice that sex is completely out of reach. No matter what a man does, he cannot get a woman of much higher value to comply to having sex with him. As a result, a woman will usually tell him “Let’s just be friends.” He becomes one of her many ‘orbiters’ and continues to fight a battle leading nowhere. In fact, there is both an instinctual and societal motivation for women to lure the men in their lives into this type of role. After all, evolutionarily, this meant more men to help raise the children she was having with the alpha male. 
<br />
Realize however, that depending on how high the value is, the orbiter will be able to get some kind of compliance from the woman, even if it isn’t full-on sex. In Fig. 2a, you can see that this fellow can get a kiss from her every now and then. How sweet. Also, it doesn’t mean he has to marry her to get a kiss. It is sufficient that she already knows she could get married to the guy, if she were so inclined. That is why the concept of the ‘no-challenge’ switch is so important. The woman has these men at her disposal for whatever survival value she wishes to take from them: Companionship, dates, spending money, backup for her real boyfriend, everything is fair game. 
<br />
Players and Fuck-Buddy (FB) Relationships Just as common as women who collect orbiters, there are guys who sleep around with many different women, no strings attached. Let’s examine Fig. 2b. 
<br />
Notice that marriage is completely out of reach. 
<br />
There is nothing this woman can do to get this guy to marry her. In fact, in this this guy probably isn’t going to be exclusive with her. Basically, all this guy has to do is show up, talk to her and give her some good emotions, and she will have sex with him. Hence the term “Fuck-Buddy”. She does however have a chance at getting dinner every once in a while, so we can call this example an “upgraded” FB relationship. Unlike women, who have both instinctual and societal motivations to lower the perceived value of their mates, for men it is merely instinctual. Societal programming tends to motivate men into beta-provider type roles. Look around and you’ll see evidence everywhere. Deep down, our genes are telling us otherwise. 
<br />
Most men, whether they admit to it or not, would love to have a few different sex partners that they aren’t committed to. After all, what kind of man doesn’t like sexual variety? From an evolutionary standpoint, these are the women that will bear his children, as he proliferates his genes. The interesting thing is, looking at Fig. 2b, we realize that this is still a traditional mindset. The escalation of compliance levels still leads to marriage. Players in this society still usually get married if they find the “right” woman. They are searching for that one woman who has high enough value or good enough game to get them to make a commitment. 
<br />
Once a man has a few girls who cater to his every need, it becomes less exciting. There’s no more challenge and nothing left to chase. What both sexes want ultimately, is high levels of compliance from high value people. In addition, the fact that sex is so high on a woman’s scale of compliance is both an outdated traditional model and unacceptable for our purposes. 
<br />
In fact, I will go so far to say that the true fundamental goal of a real pickup artist is to lower the effective compliance of sex, and move it lower on the scale. -Tools and Application- 
<br />
Reverse Supplication Levels What many guys realize as they become better with women, is that sex isn’t necessarily at the very top of a woman’s compliance scale. 
<br />
We’ve all seen women who do everything for their men. They buy them gifts, cook them dinner and clean their apartments. There are women who would practically die for their men. We also know about pimps who have their hoes out on the streetcorner, every night making money for them. These women are selling their bodies to strangers to earn money so that their men are taken care of. 
<br />
Talk about a high level of compliance! At first, it may seem completely unreal to ever have women that compliant to you. After all, there are many guys who cannot even get their girlfriends to call have sex with them! 
<br />
It turns out to be quite easy, actually, and is based on a few simple dynamics. There are all kinds of levels of compliance that reside beyond sex, leading up to full compliance which is defined as willingness to either die for a man or commit her life to his cause. Prostitution fits this basic definition close enough. The levels that reside beyond sex leading all the way up to prostitution are called the reverse supplication levels. I have defined reverse supplication as a man receiving survivial-type compliance from a woman. Inserting the reverse supplication levels into a woman’s compliance scale gives us Fig. 3a. 
<br />
As you can see I have filled in some examples into the reverse supplication levels. Dinner, clothing, a new car, all the way leading up to prostitution. Playing at that level is pimp game and I’m not interested in that right now. Between sex and prostitution is a very real region, of which holds many interesting possibilities. 
<br />
Just the simple acknowledgment of these levels lowers the effective compliance of sex. Bringing these levels into existence by reaching for them will make sex come that much easier. Value is only perception, and if you are overshooting the goal of sex by making larger requests, you can be perceived as having extremely high value. In other words, if all you want is sex, the best way to get it, is to simply set your sights BEYOND it. 
<br />
* Ask a girl to write you a poem or draw you a picture * Ask her what kind of girls she likes before you’ve even slept with her 
<br />
* Assume you’re going to sleep with other girls in her social circle before you’ve even slept with her * Find out if she has any connections to club owners and tell her you’d like VIP access 
<br />
Keep in mind, you aren’t taking value from others, you are merely increasing your own perceived value, such that everything you give is appreciated to a higher degree. It will make everything you do that much more powerful. People will be more likely to listen to you, more likely to laugh at your jokes and more likely to try to get rapport with you. I won’t go too far into this here, but the basic formula for escalating compliance is to take it one small step at a time. We aren’t talking a few dates, this stuff can take months. Compliance is pliable. When you have a woman at breaking point and push her threshold, her maximum level of compliance increases. 
<br />
Another key is making it fun and worthwhile for a woman to do these things. Make your requests that are related to your identity. If you are a chef, have her pick up some groceries so you can prepare a romantic dinner. If you are an artist, have her pick up a new set of brushes, and let her watch you create a masterpiece. Build a lifestyle in which the two of you can share. Though this article is only a small portion of my entire reverse supplication method, it is still powerful enough to warrant two points of caution. Firstly, do not use this method for abuse. Women do these things because they love us and care for us. Don’t run this on a poor college girl, and don’t run it on a woman you aren’t willing to be straight with. Use it carefully to develop your lifestyle and enhance the experiences that you share together. Secondly, don’t ever become so dependent that you lose responsibility for yourself. If it ever gets to the point that you cannot maintain your finances or keep your apartment clean all by yourself, you’ll be in trouble. Trust me on this one. 
<br />
Set High Expectations When it comes to value, nothing beats having high expectations of other people and putting a price on yourself. 
<br />
So many guys are willing to sacrifice their own best interests in order to make a girl happy, or to get together with her. Don’t go driving two hours out of the way just to see her, don’t ditch your buddies to hang out with her, and don’t volunteer to buy her dinner if you’ve just met her. In addition, you should expect women to respect you and treat you well. If you compliment a woman, expect her to respond positively to it. Many guys fail with compliments because they don’t hold her to high expectations and instead continue to be nice to her after she has disrespected them by ignoring the compliment. 
<br />
Make a woman commit to giving you full attention when you are communicating with her, whether it be in person, on the phone or even in a chat room. Also be willing to walk away if she doesn’t meet your standards. There are plenty of women that will. Most of the time a willingness to walk will only help you, and draw them in closer. The best way to punish bad behavior is with indifference. Any reaction whatsoever is actually a reward, because it telegraphs your emotional investment. Sometimes it helps to make it absolutely clear what she did wrong in a dominant, (not angry) voice, and then follow it with indifference, both physical and verbal. 
<br />
Value Flux and Reward Calibration There are times in an interaction with a woman when your value is in flux. That is, your value has no definition. Realize that this is not necessarily a bad thing but rather an opportunity to define it. 
<br />
The first situation that causes value flux was mentioned above - it is when you make a compliance request. For example you try to kiss her, and she either obliges or rejects you. Your value is then defined by your reaction to it. The second situation is when a girl displays good behavior. That is, she does something to indicate a higher level of compliance then where she was at previously. For example: she calls you, she follows you as you lead her around the club, or she buys you a new pair of shoes. These are all examples of good behavior. 
<br />
Good behavior should never be punished, except in small amounts. In general it should be rewarded. Sometimes punishing good behavior in small amounts works to confuse her and obsess about you. Major jumps in positive compliance in her part should be rewarded. But how should her good behavior be rewarded? 
<br />
In this example, the woman has kissed you. In general this behavior is in the right direction and should be rewarded. There is a wide range of ways to do this, but keep in mind, your reward will define your value, and therefore how she responds to you in the future. Let’s say after the kiss, you decide to make her your girlfriend and be exclusive to her. See Figure 4b. 
<br />
So the girl kisses you, and you decide to be exclusive to her. You start the “relationship talk” and tell her you’ve decided that you only want to see her. Bad move. It would probably result in her telling you to take a hike, unless she’s a virgin and kissing is pretty high on her scale anyway. Since exclusivity is pretty high on your compliance scale, transposing your value bar so that it lines up with kissing would result in an extremely low perceived value. 
<br />
Ok let’s see what happens instead if you merely give her a compliment after she has kissed you. 
<br />
As we see there, rewarding her kiss with a simple compliment goes a lot further. You will create a much higher perceived value for yourself, and in the process increase your chances of more positive responses in the future. By creating a large amount of perceived value, you present yourself as a challenge to be overcome. A woman will realize that her efforts will be both appreciated and at the same time, it will be an interesting chase. 
<br />
Previously I mentioned that it is the ultimate goal to lower the effective level of sexual compliance. That is, get it as low as possible on the compliance scale. Using these concepts, it shouldn’t be very difficult. Eventually it will get to a point where it hits the bottom and drops off her scale altogether. 
<br />
The True Alpha Male Although both value bars for the man and woman may be high, through skillful game and correct attitudes, the effective compliance of sex will eventually drop off the bottom of the woman’s bar. 
<br />
Where does it go once that happens? To your compliance scale. 
<br />
Any given interaction between a man and a woman must appear on either the man or the woman’s side. (One party always wants something a little bit more than the other, no matter how slight the difference may be) So it may not have a lot of weight, but it is going to show up on one of the scales. If you reduce the compliance of sex so much that it disappears from the woman’s bar, it must appear on your side. This is what happens when you truly become the prize of the interaction. 
<br />
This situation represents a natural and fundamental scenario of a true alpha male. This happens when the highest value that a woman can contribute is her energy and resources, and the highest contribution the man can make is his genes. 
<br />
This is the difference between a real alpha male and what the general population believes is alpha. Since most people identify alphas with taking up space, walking slow and talking very loud, this is a significant improvement. Keep in mind although full compliance is defined here as prostitution, it doesn’t mean the girls are actually selling themselves at full compliance, it just means that they would be willing to and their man knows fully he has that power over them. 
<br />
While most men are out there struggling just to get the pussy, you can rise above that. I invite you now to imagine fully what is possible. Don’t set your goals so low that you would be thrilled just to get laid. Realize the bigger picture of what is possible. Live a lifestyle where women are making your dreams come true in every area of your life. 
<br />
In what ways can a woman support your aspirations and contribute to your happiness? Allow them to bring you excitement and energy, and imagine a life where they are doing all of this simply for the opportunity to please you sexually.<br /><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
